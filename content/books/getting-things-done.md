It is not that it was boring, but I had great difficulty following the book. It addresses something important for my lifestyle (hence the two stars), yet it becomes very tedious with every single detail about which specific folder to use and when. The structure is very rigid, which in theory should appeal to me, but ultimately does not interest me. For the most part it repeats "write things down" and relies on specific structures in the author's mind that do not resonate with me.

I agree that it is important to have a system to process all our information and then query it when needed. I am glad I already have a draft, and GTD could give me ideas for further improvements. I will use parts of it.

- If we do not manage our "open loops", we tire our brain
- The feeling of being "overwhelmed" comes from not knowing what our next actions are. Most people feel stressed because they lack clarity and feel they have countless things to do, but they can avoid this by managing themselves well - I need to turn everything I have lying around into an organized archive
- Define "what" you need to do; the reminder needs a verb, not a vague idea. Otherwise it becomes an "open loop" and your mind keeps holding on to it
- The mind is for having ideas, not for storing them; trust the archive
- It is a waste of time to think about something on which you cannot yet act.
- The 5 steps to manage the workflow:
Capture → note what has your attention
Clarify → think it through and describe the note's details and context
Organize → put it in the right place: reference, to do, maybe, trash, or delegate
Reflect → review it often, for example in the weekly review
Engage → do it.
- Weekly review is essential: take a couple of hours to review the whole system each week, for example on Friday afternoon.
- Allen's workflow example. I find it a bit complex, but I will leave it for reference
