## Notes
- Brilliant. Accounting explained through a lemonade stand
- Balance Sheet: Assets always = Liabilities + Owner's Equity
- Concept of Payables and Receivables: the accrual method does not follow cash
- FIFO and LIFO for inventory, used in "creative accounting"
- Expenses (such as interest or a helper) affect earnings
- Income Statement: measures Net Profit. Sales - COGS - Expenses
- Fixed Assets and Depreciation, the stand and a new cart
- Liquidity problems: running out of cash at the store right before the game was a poor choice. The most important lesson is this. Mistakes happen. Brief mention of the Cash Flow Statement
- Key indicators: past performance and competitors. Use the ratio among Expenses, Net Profit, and COGS to see how different periods performed.
