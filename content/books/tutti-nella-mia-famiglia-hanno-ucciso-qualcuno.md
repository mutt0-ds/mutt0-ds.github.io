Fantastic book, a mystery I tore through in two days that thrilled me on every page. The author has a great sense of irony, uses meta in a brilliant way, and packs in a lot of twists and reveals that are not too forced (and he acknowledges it when they are). Fantastic concept; I need to keep an eye on Stevenson, he writes so well. A friend recommended it.

The plot revolves around a family, the Cunninghams, whose secrets about each member are revealed little by little, and they really have killed "someone." I love how he spoils things yet still manages to fool you with his wording, making the spoilers intriguing.
