Recommended on Hacker News for project management. I found it rather dry and vague, very conceptual and abstract. Fortunately, it was a quick read (79 pages), so it may not stick with me.

It illustrates the concept of an impact map, like this one, for organizing a project.

It should answer questions like what, who, when, how, and the book explains some useful points and mistakes to avoid when designing the map.

Postponed until I have a project to manage; for now it feels too abstract. [Here](https://marcabraham.com/2014/01/14/book-review-impact-mapping/) is a brief description of the book that may be useful
