I heard good things about it, the story of Scott's reckless journey. A monotonous read, it is really an account of the days, the miles, and the mishaps: first this ill-advised trip to collect penguin eggs, then Scott's, which ended badly.

Decent, not very gripping, but it makes you think about the brutal conditions they traveled in a hundred years ago, and they managed, more or less. Heroes, credit for their tenacity. Very detailed about all the steps of the famous trip, with nightmarish conditions.

A remarkable journey all the same, a pity about Scott's mistakes, above all not using dogs but ponies. Interesting how the missions worked.
