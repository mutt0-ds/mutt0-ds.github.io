The book by my favorite fitness YouTuber. It could be very useful for my training. And in fact it turned out to be a foundational read. Very useful for starting a structured program, very motivational, and with a simple, scientific approach that convinced me right away. A substantial, potentially life-changing read. It makes me eager to train.

## Notes

- You need to understand the scientific fundamentals to build the right strategy. But for a beginner, just showing up is great. Science suggests 30 to 60 minutes of resistance training per week.
> Any training is better than no training.
- Jeff distinguishes between compound exercises (deadlift, squat, bench press) and isolation ones. Compound lifts are harder, but they move many muscles at once. You need to make a trade-off.
- Watch out for pain. Lifting is very safe, but if you feel persistent pain, reduce the load for a couple of weeks or rest.
- ⭐ Control the negative. The movement should be strong both on the way down and on the way up, so you use your strength fully. Always controlled. Deep stretch at the bottom and full squeeze at the top. If you control the negative, time does not matter. You can take 2 or 8 seconds.
- The weight must be appropriate. Jeff dives into the details, but 6 to 15 reps works. Fewer if you really want to focus on strength, more for detail work.
- ⭐ The limit is often mental. Your brain does not think you can do another rep. Think of being in a high-pressure test and push for one more. That is your real limit.
- How to measure progress? Bodyweight is usually misleading. Take a mirror photo every month; muscles are a visual result. Weight and body fat are context. If you play the long game, strength, photos, and weight together are good pivots.
- Another mental trick: bundle something you do not like (e.g., cardio) with something you enjoy (listening to new music). Worth keeping in mind.
- ⭐ You usually give your best on the first exercise, with fresh muscles. If you want to improve something specific, put it first. Do compound/primary lifts first for this reason, since they are more complete.
- Simple breathing: breathe in on the negative. Breathe out on the positive.
- [Long list of exercises with step-by-step guidance. There are also great programs at the end; I will reread them one day.]
- Beyond what he suggests on YouTube, good exercises include:
  - goblet squat
  - the main ones (squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press)
  - some heavy ones (lat pulldowns, cable rows, lunges, hip thrusts, and pull-ups)
  - completed with isolation exercises
  - usually a 50/50 split between machines and free weights
  - "Don't do exercises you hate"
- ⭐ Most novices stop well before their true limit. They will not grow muscle optimally. DON'T UNDERTRAIN.
- How to avoid it? Push until you physically cannot move or you start to cheat. Form comes first. Failure training means just that. Push to the point of failure: it is the most efficient and effective way to maximize muscle growth. The logic is simple: if the muscle gets used to a given level of stress, it stops growing. You must keep stimulating it.
- ⭐ That does not mean do it all the time. He explains a method: on average, stop 0 to 3 reps shy of failure. It is called RIR.
- [Various calculations to increase weight progressively; my app is working quite well for now]
- ⭐ Frequency: 10 sets per month per muscle group for a beginner. Even 1 to 4 helps just to start. The number of reps is not important as long as you go to failure and stay between 6 and 15.
- ⭐ Workout splits: there is full body, single muscle group, and variations. I like push/pull/legs (chest, shoulders, and triceps vs back, biceps, and forearms vs quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and adductors), a nice split. But there is no strict rule.
- Rest is not overly important. Rest between sets just enough to recover calmly, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
- [Advanced techniques, skipping for now]
- On vacation, do not stress; the gym will be there when you return. Try something different to stay active: run, walk, swim.
- Diet: what matters is energy balance over time. If you are above maintenance, you gain weight; below, you lose weight. Focus on the trend.
- Drinking is not particularly harmful; 1 or 2 beers occasionally is fine.
- Food before the workout is better, like a good breakfast. There are various studies and techniques, but do not overthink it. A good, abundant pre-workout meal. Protein is always better; before or after changes little.
- Protein supplements are recommended, as are caffeine (in moderation; I personally skip it) and creatine, but none are essential.
- Cardio is good, but it does not build muscle effectively; it is more for losing body fat. Do at most 10 minutes before the workout, or do it after. It is not even an excellent fat-loss tool because your body adapts and burns less with habit. Actually, lifting weights burns a lot of energy.
- ⭐ The less active you are outside the gym, the more cardio will help you anyway.
