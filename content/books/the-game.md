In theory a book about pickup artists, Mr. Rip recommends it to learn what manipulation techniques could be used on you. 

> It is a masterpiece. It is the Gomorrah of the pickup artist world. Sad, but a masterpiece. Strauss tells of his descent, which started from an article he was supposed to write for a newspaper, into the world of "pickup artists." People who then end up badly, lonely and sad, notches on bedposts and the like. The Pablo Escobars of hookups. A narrative and introspective masterpiece.

Written really well; toward the end it bored me a bit. But his writing is incredible. And it is all true.

## Notes

This summary is not bad, even if it talks more about pickup lines than the story: https://thepowermoves.com/the-game-neil-strauss/. Another good summary: https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/the-game-book/

What I take away is that the world is strange, that these guys had everything, but the void to fill is always there, and that happiness is not about racking up numbers of women. The best part was when he dumped the mountain of phone numbers on the bed and said "I had all these, but I chose you."

Anyway, Neil writes very well; he kept me hooked for most of the book. It was interesting to see his transformation into a guru. He analyzes details and tells stories, presents other people obsessed with pickup, but always with a tone that is both serious and light.

The final message I read is that for serious relationships, you have to be yourself. I felt sorry for them.

As the review says, 2 stars for dating advice, and 4 for entertainment. Neil writes very well.
