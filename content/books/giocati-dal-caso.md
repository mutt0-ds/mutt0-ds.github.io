They say it's more readable than the others and makes a good point, like how luck is what keeps us going, for better or worse.

I think that compared to many finance tomes it is definitely more readable, but Taleb just doesn't grab me. The story of Nero, who then crashes, is ok, the message is not to get carried away, that it's all luck and we have biases, but then I got a bit lost in the repetitions. The point is that we must always understand that chance drives everything, and there are events, black swans, that we do not predict, so we should avoid taking too many risks. Or rather, be antifragile and bet on the risks that will come. The usual stuff, but I think a bit easier for a beginner. I wouldn't reread it.
