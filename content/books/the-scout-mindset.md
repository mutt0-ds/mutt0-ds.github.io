Nice book. Nothing exceptional; it is about thinking critically and with curiosity, engaging with opposing views and respecting those who disagree. It also takes a lot of humility and the ability to admit you were wrong. An easy introduction to the topic.

## Notes

- The scout mindset is the motivation to see things as they are, not as you hope they are
- In short, it means considering that you might be wrong and staying open to other interpretations. Welcome the truth, even if it hurts. Respect honesty
- If you want to advocate for an idea, you need to understand why you hold it: the more evidence we gather for a belief, the easier it is to persuade others it is sound. Also, be passionate. "What convinces is conviction."
- To persuade someone who thinks very differently, facts often are not enough. You need to respect them and speak politely until you plant the doubt that will guide their later choices
- Instead of stroking our ego by ignoring fallacies, we can build credibility by noticing them and showing that we "update" based on what we discover
- Soldier mindset: Can I believe it? Scout mindset: Must I believe it? Use the second to see more clearly, not to convince others. You are in a debate to see clearly.
- Attitude to have while listening to others: nod and listen, with follow-up questions
- Hard, but when you present a point AITA-style, you should make it impersonal, or bias will creep in
- Being able to handle criticism, even conceding points to the other person, is the start of a healthy debate and sets you apart
- If you are embarrassed to ask a "stupid" question in class or elsewhere, ask yourself: if someone else did it, what would you think?
- The goal should not be to make a claim; it should be to figure out what is true and right. Remember the difference between a press secretary and a board of directors. One declares. The other acts
- Tip: give precise estimates and say where they come from. E.g., "I am not sure in this case, but a similar study shows 23% interest in this topic"
- People do not like uncertainty because then they do not know what to do. Always have an approach to suggest after you present the issues. You need a plan!
- A scout's opinions grow and update as they learn new things. Scouts see anomalies as puzzle pieces to collect along the way. You might not know what to do with them at first, but then they fit
- Listen to those with opposing views, but know that it is very, very hard to change them. They need to follow the scout mindset, learning step by step
- Scouts start with a rough map and evolve it over time with more information
- Instead of behaving irrationally, define the details and understand how they evolve the map

> if I were to name one single facet I find most inspiring, it's the idea of being intellectually honorable: wanting the truth to win out, and putting that principle above your own ego.
