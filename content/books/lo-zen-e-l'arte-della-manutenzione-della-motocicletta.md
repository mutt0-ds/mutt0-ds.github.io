This book mostly left me confused, with a lot of fluff; I am not made for this kind of writing style.

The story works on three levels: a journey of the protagonist, his son Chris, and their friends (and honestly, there is no plot; they just wander), then the attempt to remember what happened to his past self, Phaedrus, who evidently had a breakdown and was institutionalized, and a philosophical digression on the definition of Quality, with a Sophist and Aristotelian dialogue and exploration.

Honestly, I did not understand much, but I liked the practical parts when it talks about the bike (two stars). The ending just made me think they overcomplicated things, focusing on every single nuance of the dialogue and making everything needlessly complex to prove abstract points. I just feel I didn't get the point of the book at all.
