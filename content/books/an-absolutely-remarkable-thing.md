Recommended on Reddit as sci-fi fiction much better than Ready Player Two. That was all I knew going in.

I have to say, really good. It is about a mysterious robot, Carl, and how an ordinary woman becomes famous overnight after discovering it. Well written and very engaging; it explores how fame can go to your head and how people complicate their lives. The protagonist feels very human, in that she makes mistakes, and she stays relatable; you empathize. Excellent, though the ending does not explain much. Looking forward to the sequel.
