Excellent book, it keeps you hooked until the end and is an interesting exploration of the human psyche. As a story, it is a bit contrived in terms of logic, too convenient that a character would act like that, but the twist was fantastic. Absolutely unexpected. One of the best I have ever read. I am not giving 5 stars because the whole thing feels a bit contrived, but I loved how the voices of Theo and Alicia alternated and came together at the end.

> "About love. About how we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant. I imagine you do give Kathy love - in the true sense of the word. Whether or not she is capable of giving it back to you is another question." Love that doesn't include honesty doesn't deserve to be called love.
