summary: "Small actions compound over time. The things you do every day, the things that don't look like they matter, do matter. They not only make a difference - they make all the difference."

Nice book, very easy to read, though it becomes quite repetitive over time; it could have been shorter. Its principle, small steps every day, is easy to remember and will help me. I will use the chapter summaries for the recap.

## Notes

- Small steps. It offers many good examples, like the penny that doubles every day and becomes a million in a month, or the flower that covers the entire pond, compound interest.
- There is no recipe for happiness; the key ingredient is philosophy. It shapes my attitude, which then shapes my small daily actions (habits). Those make the difference.
- Choices are easy to do and easy not to do. You can decide to skip them, but as they add up they take you up or down.
- Today everyone wants to go fast, but the secret is to grow the little plant of our actions. Time will tell.
- Start with a penny: it will be simple, but you have to jump in and do something to get started!
    - 7 Principles, a good long chapter to reread: see figure. The most important is integrity. Do what you told yourself you would do even if no one is watching, even if you feel down or don't feel like it. ALWAYS.
    - Everything is dynamic, you can't stay static: ahead there are two paths, one down and one up (and guess the split, 95/5 percent).
- Invest in yourself: study, improve, focus on personal development.
- To reach your goals, write them down, create a plan, look at it every day, and understand that you will have to make sacrifices (good chapter).
