A very charming and positive book, sometimes even a bit excessively euphoric. Each chapter is a small thing to be happy about, whether it's the smell of gasoline, being first in a line, rolling over a milestone on the odometer, nodding off in the car on the way home, leaving someone at the gas station as a prank, catching the smell of dinner when you walk in the door, and so much more. They're often described with funny details, and overall you can tell they're blog-style pieces. I enjoyed it and recommend it for a rough day.

A lovely ending explains that we live in a world of billions and have at most 100 years to enjoy it, so let's learn to enjoy everything. He also thanks his friend Kim, with whom he shared many wonderful moments.
