## Notes

- Wanting a more positive experience is itself negative. And, paradoxically, accepting your negative experience is itself a positive experience
- Be comfortable with not caring, and reserve it for things that are worth it: example an older woman at the supermarket, focused on her own small world
- Happiness is a problem: Buddha. An endless series of problems, dissatisfaction
- You are not special; measure yourself against yourself, not others (Best vs. Mustaine)

1. Take responsibility, even if it is not your fault: you act
2. I know that I don't know: understand that we are often wrong
3. Embrace failure: you grow from it. Action-reaction cycle, DO SOMETHING
4. Rejection: example telling a spouse about their hair. Do not avoid rejection out of fear; trust
5. Death: sooner or later we will die, what will you have left behind?
