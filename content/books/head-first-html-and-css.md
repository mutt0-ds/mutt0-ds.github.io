A nice read. As usual, the friendly Head First style works well for learning dry topics like HTML and CSS. I have to say the book is a bit outdated; it spends a lot of time on cross-browser differences that are not as important now, at least in my view. The design also felt about 10 years old, and CSS is more advanced visually today. Still, it was nice to see the creation of a site for a coffee shop, Starbuzz.

I learned the basics, the different kinds of classes, and a few CSS tricks, but many sections felt superfluous and I skipped the exercises, since it felt too easy.

Average overall. It did not bore me, but it did not leave anything memorable.
