Recommended by Mr Rip, who says it will change the way we read a book. I am very curious.

Unfortunately it did not resonate with me. Much of the book is taking passages from other books and analyzing them, but I did not enjoy it. I ended up skipping many and was bored. Clearly I'm not the right audience. Better recap: https://sbhowell.com/2014/02/reading-like-a-writer-by-francine-prose/

I did not get much out of it; maybe On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by King would have been better for learning how to write. Here it mostly made me realize that behind every word there is a careful selection, and it is fascinating how much work is involved. Writing, and reading, is an art. And I know I don't have the love of detail that a writer may have. But I will pay more attention!
