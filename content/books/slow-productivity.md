Recommended on Reddit as one of the most interesting technical books these days. It is more philosophical than technical, to be honest, but that's fine. Newport is good; he is the author of Deep Work.

I put it down after 3 or 4 chapters. Quite dull, and I barely remember the key points, aside from the idea that the more you rush and try to do many things at once, the more confusion you create. Choose one thing at a time and focus on that. Keep a short to-do list and follow it. Newport keeps returning to the same idea, that productivity requires calm and organization, not frantic rushing. Not much else, some thoughts on what productivity is and the usual anecdotes. Dull.
