Part of The Carls series, obviously to be read after An Absolutely Remarkable Thing, they say it is a bit flatter.

Still, nice and interesting. It explains a lot of things that were not clear in the first one, and it delivers a clear message against the oligarchy of the powerful and big tech. Nice! Lots of lessons.
