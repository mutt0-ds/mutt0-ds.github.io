So, I wanted to read some classics, and this was recommended as a good read on Reddit. I picked it up at the library.

Good book. Raw, brutal, it explains the horrors and the futility of war, alternating with lighter, human moments, jokes, thefts, and feasts. War is vile. Pure atrocity. I devoured it.
