_Encyclopedia of flavor combinations: you should always create a balanced dish, and you have endless ingredients to play with_

Recommended on Reddit as similar to Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat

It is a cooking encyclopedia, so it is not an easy read. It has lists of combinations I can use. I will use it as a reference for flavor combinations based on the ingredients I have. The structure is nice, with stories, anecdotes, and recipes here and there. It seems like a good book that could inspire and give you a perspective from great chefs, who focus on balance and flavor.
