summary: 'Do not trust Mr. Market. Do not buy shares, buy the underlying business: value investing is about noticing whether there is a (wide enough) gap between price and value, and exploiting it.'

The "Bible" of value investing, the principle by which Buffett and others beat the index. His closing piece is excellent (about coin-flippers who are random, then he moves to Graham's disciples). A long read; without Zweig's commentary I would have stopped weeks ago, but it lays out important principles, first among them not trusting Mr. Market, the crowd. I am pasting a few key points.

## Notes

- Intelligent investors don't rush in; they take time to rationally examine a company's long-term value: there is a difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term strategy.
- Intelligent investing is broken down into three principles: the company's financial structure, management's ability, and dividend history.
- Intelligent investors understand the importance of stock-market history: P/E ratio, ups and downs, foresee overpriced periods, etc. Cyclicality.
- Don't trust the crowd or the market: best part. Analogy with Mr. Market, a moody and irrational character who buys when there's hype and sells when panicked. He throws low-priced stocks at you when they are "on sale", for example. Ignore his actions.
- Enterprising investors start similarly to defensive investors, but they diversify across different stocks. Do not take excessive risk.
- The enterprising investor doesn't follow the market's ups and downs. Don't listen to Mr. Market. Buy when people don't like a stock, when it is in a bad period or simply ignored. Likewise, ignore "hyped" stocks; they are probably overpriced.
- The enterprising investor has the chance to find real bargains: read financial statements (there are many examples and comparisons), explore and learn. Find underrated but valuable businesses, and voila.

I will add that, besides Zweig, who really shined, Buffett was outstanding: I loved his sections, both intro and outro. A bit old-style, but the book is interesting and laid the foundations for value investing, which is not really my focus, but it helps me understand how the big players work.
