If I want to work at a FAANG company, it's recommended by pretty much everyone.

A boring read, but it should be treated as a workbook, while I was just looking at the solutions. I didn't understand a lot of C++ and Java; I'll revisit it when I have an interview.

Solid advice and good questions. I picked up a few bits about networking, memory allocation, languages I didn't know, and logic tricks. It can be useful, but I need to try the exercises on my own; skimming it like this doesn't help me.
