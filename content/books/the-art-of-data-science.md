Recommended on Instagram, a simple and quick read but also quite vague and lightweight. It did not leave me with much beyond a couple of lines in R, a reminder about population/Simpson bias, and how to use different models for hypotheses and maybe average them.

Peng writes well. It could be interesting for a beginner, and it shows exploratory analysis and data cleaning well. It was not that useful for me.
