Well, it's a piece-by-piece analysis of Obama's speeches, not exactly thrilling. But it manages to be interesting; it's nice to see how he structures his talks.

Humility, heavy use of repetition and rhetorical devices like juxtapositions, antitheses, and lists, lingering on individual words, symbolism and rhetorical figures, not over-enumerating, using the rule of three, adding concrete details, using "we" and "I" to bring people together, personifying ideas, using rhetorical questions, anticipating counterpoints, ending with great solemnity and a call to action, a pinch of humor, and telling many stories and anecdotes.

I doubt anyone gets to that level, but I have to say, great speeches and the analysis is solid. A bit repetitive and heavy, though.
