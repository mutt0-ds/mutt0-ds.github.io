Found it recommended on Reddit? Not sure. A classic that conveys a simple idea, with a tone that feels slightly old-fashioned and heavy for my taste. Overall it was enjoyable, but I missed a clear takeaway; I will probably forget most of it, except the part about asking lots of questions and paraphrasing with feelings.
 
## Notes

- Keep your observations and judgments to yourself. How will people react if you judge them?
- The formula is "I feel XXXX when XXXX because XXXX." Observing, Feelings, Needs, Making Requests.
- Behind each feeling of anger or a bad mood there is an unmet need. Understand what is really behind it and own it; ask the other person about it and guide them to talk about it.
- I feel is different from I think. Do not project your judgment onto what you feel.
- Notice how you tend to label people and why you do it.
- Take responsibility. It is not other people's fault that you feel the way you do, but it is your job to acknowledge it and improve.
- State your needs in positive terms.
- Paraphrase others' needs when they share their problems. There are many examples of dialogues (some a bit odd, to be honest) where the person complains or has problems, and he keeps asking questions to guide them in expressing their needs.
- Empathy. Observe without judgment.

> Empathy is not about fixing or changing the other person. It's about understanding and accepting them as they are. When you can do that, connecting with them is much easier.
