Good book that covers 11 feminist battles (from sport to abortion, to work, to the right to be difficult), focusing on the pioneers and their traits. I found it very direct but never too heavy (apart from a couple of passages on the torture of suffragettes and the many abuses they suffered). The author researches well, even interviewing some of the key figures, and offers a transparent, honest account. By her own description "imperfect," but excellent work, recommended reading.
