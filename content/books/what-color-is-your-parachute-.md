It was a rough read; I had to push through to finish it, and I did not like it for several reasons. The basics make sense (study and explore yourself, look at what the company does and find contacts instead of mass-sending CVs, network, prepare for interviews), but they are presented in a rather irritating way.

The author sprinkles links and websites very frequently, which comes across as promotional, often pointing to his ancillary services and print editions.

Then the first half is a step-by-step guide to the "flower," presented as the key to finding a job in 86% of cases. Know yourself, your desires and skills, the usual themes, but delivered in a dull way.

The second part was fine. I liked the tip about reaching out to people at the companies you target and getting to know them personally. Talk with employees, listen, note everything: the goal is to get to an interview and then bring out the insights explored in the flower.

An ordinary book; he knows how to market himself. I think the flower image alone would suffice. The final chapter on Christianity focuses on spirituality, which felt out of place to me.
