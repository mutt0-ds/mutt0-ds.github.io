summary: "Mathematics is fascinating. Officially proving the Riemann hypothesis is important but extremely difficult because of how it is structured"

I already know it is five stars, I remember starting it before 2020, and it got me interested in mathematics and this fascinating mystery.

Reread in September and I liked it a lot, I understood better how the Riemann hypothesis works and the impact it has in the real world (especially on cryptography and other theories). Really good, well written, I only got a bit lost at the end with the quantum mechanics, it is not a simple book but the best on mathematics around. Siria read a tiny beginner version by Sautoy, "How to Count to Infinity". Nice.

Here I confirm what I said: the history of mathematics, explained clearly and in an entertaining way. What more could you want?
