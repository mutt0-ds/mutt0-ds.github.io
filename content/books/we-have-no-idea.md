_We should be EXCITED about all the things we still do not know_

Recommended by Mr. Rip. It is a popular science book about what we know about the universe, full of illustrations. Masterpiece. Wonderful book. 

I loved the narrative style, fun and light, and very clear and specific when needed. I learned a ton of things, from theories of everything, quarks, black holes, the speed of light, space, time, the Big Bang, and dark matter and energy. Highly recommended.
