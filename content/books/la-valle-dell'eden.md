So, I wanted to read some classics. Picked it up at the library.

Decently written, but I stopped at about a fifth. It follows different families and generations, with brothers who fight and strong character portraits. Very readable, but it's 800 pages, and I wasn't that invested in the characters. It happens, it just didn't grab me.
