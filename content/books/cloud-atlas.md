From https://www.nateliason.com/notes/cloud-atlas-david-mitchell, excellent book. The film didn't convince me, the book is well written, though a couple of parts were heavy (future and caveman). Nice idea of linking the various stories, it is much clearer in the book, but I don't see a huge impact from the previous chapters (apart from Somni becoming a deity). Good book overall, enjoyable. In my view the film was not really necessary, difficult material to handle.

One thing that struck me is that slaves in one era can become deities millennia later, nothing is forever and everything is connected
