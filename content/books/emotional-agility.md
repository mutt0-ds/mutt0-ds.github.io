Suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/12nmc3r/what_are_some_of_the_best_books_resources_and/) on Reddit as a book on communicating and understanding emotions. I was looking for something on the window of tolerance; it is not strictly related, but they know their stuff there. Let's see if it can help me understand and communicate better.

So-so, it has some interesting points but it is an overlong article ([here](https://hbr.org/2013/11/emotional-agility) is the original). And rereading the notes, it does have material of value. OK.

One interesting point is that we often bottle our feelings (men) or brood over them (women). Instead, we should be agile, manage them, and talk about what we are experiencing.

### Notes

- 🔑 There are 4 main steps:
  1. showing up: facing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
  2. stepping out: being able to detach from and observe thoughts and emotions
  3. walking your why: making choices based on core values and goals
  4. moving on: making small tweaks influenced by values, and finding balance on the teeter-totter between challenge and competence
- Specialists are often the last to notice details, because they are caught up in their habits
- 🔑 Anxiety is us imagining the worst scenarios to feel prepared. But that exhausts us and does not help, because we are imagining absurd things and not living in the moment
- Avoid bottling (you need to express your emotions; you are not really in control, you are suppressing)
- Avoid brooding (stewing in your misery)
- Just show up. Bring out your emotions, admit what you are feeling (and have the other person admit it too, like ask them to explain what they are feeling)
- Words matter; we need to correctly identify the feeling we are experiencing to find the support we need
- Ask yourself "what the func?" - what is this emotion for? Why am I feeling it now? What is my body telling me?
- Take the sentence that makes you anxious "I am fat" "I will fail this project" and repeat it ten times. Notice how it loses meaning?
- 🔑 I liked the example of the couple arguing because one leaves the coat on the floor; it put everything in perspective. Siria cares about me, and if she leaves things around it is because that is how she is or she is tired. In truth she wants a clean home as much as I do. RECOGNIZE THE OTHER'S LIMITS:
She made a conscious decision, going forward, to let go of the subjective threads she'd woven into that coat and to assume only the most generous intentions on David's part. Instead of being hooked on what David was or was not doing by leaving it on the floor, she would give him a birthday gift: She would accept this was simply a part of David, a person whom she loved, and that without a sense of injured pride or resentment, she would lovingly pick up his coat. She would end the tug-of-war by dropping the rope.
- Social Snacking -> if you are tied up with something e.g. a long shift at work, even just sending a message in 5 seconds to your partner means a lot
- Obviously, praise others for the effort they put in, not only for who they are and the outcome!
- Example of asking a child who is throwing a tantrum what they feel and how they would face this feeling -> okay
- Two nice lines in the conclusion:
  - Recognize that life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility. We're young, until we're not. We're healthy, until we're not. We're with those we love, until we're not.
  - And finally, remember to "dance if you can."
