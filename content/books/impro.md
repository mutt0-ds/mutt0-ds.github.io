One of the recommended reads at Palantir, it intrigued me. I realized that being able to speak and improvise is very important. In the end it turned out to be a heavy read, hard to follow, and I almost dropped it toward the end. Not light, unless you are an actor and doing the exercises: the book is full of them, dozens. I was the wrong audience, though I see why they recommend it.

But the gist, the golden rule of improvisation, is to forget what we think we know. Children, who have not yet been boxed in creatively, often come up with solutions that are more creative than those of older students and adults.

So, to improvise, do not overthink. Say what you actually have in mind, even if it seems silly, crude, or unkind. Also, let people be free to create and invent: the more restless students are often the ones who most need to channel their creativity, and stifling it is a waste.

Another key point is that in a conversation, someone leads and someone yields. Status matters, and you should always pay attention to power dynamics in a conversation. With a few words you can flip them, which can give you an advantage, for example when you need to persuade someone.

When you improvise, you reveal your true self. The real one.
