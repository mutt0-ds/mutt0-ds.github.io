## Notes

1. Make peace with the past: tally total earnings and total liabilities of your life
2. Be in the present: calculate life energy and track every cent that comes in and goes out
3. Where does it all go? Monthly tabulation with a large spreadsheet, converting amounts into life energy
4. 3 fundamental questions: do I have satisfaction/fulfillment, is it in line with my values, and how would it change if I did not have to work "for a living"? + or -
5. Show Life Energy: Wall Chart with the trend over time of income - expenses
6. Value Life Energy: rules for saving, focus on true needs
7. Value Life Energy 2: maximize earnings, maintain integrity
8. Crossover point: the point where your passive income equals your expenses
9. Manage finances: bonds & co, fairly outdated.
