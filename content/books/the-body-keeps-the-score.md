Chosen somewhat at random, it is a read I am glad I undertook, though very long. I fear I did not absorb part of the content, since I read it in a fragmented way, with another book in between.

## Notes

Van der Kolk examines his patients over the years and begins by explaining how past traumatic events upset people, keeping them in states of distress that can lead to various abuses and further problems. Medication dulls the symptoms but does not resolve the problem.

The issue is that our primitive brain reacts to stress with "freeze" or "attack" modes. When a person is trapped in a situation they cannot escape and suffers, the brain stays locked in that state of alarm, causing severe reactions that range from withdrawal into oneself (freeze) to anger and hatred (attack). Certain triggers set off the brain's memories, which have never left the traumatic moment and think they are still there.

He focuses on children, who are more vulnerable, with research showing, for example, how those who had a distant or troubled family are statistically more likely to develop more problems decades later. They can remain "stuck" in these self-defense states even as adults.

For recovery, he introduces practices such as yoga and EMDR, which help patients calmly regulate body and mind in a natural way.

A somewhat rough summary, I admit; I will need to revisit it if I read it again. I have to say the subject does not engage me much.
