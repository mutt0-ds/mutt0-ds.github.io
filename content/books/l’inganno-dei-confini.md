[Nova Lectio](https://www.youtube.com/@NovaLectio)'s book. It talks about borders, and most of it has already been explored in his videos; nothing special, yet it is still pleasant to flip through and catch glimpses of history.

Yes, a nice book; there are many interesting episodes and many insights I knew thanks to his videos. It is an easy read.

The main theme is the deception behind the idea of the border, something we created, often debated or not very sensible. There are stories, from Yugoslavia to calculation errors in South America, that keep explaining why these questionable choices were made, whether for historical reasons or complicated agreements meant to satisfy everyone. What remains is that borders matter, they grant access to valuable resources, and states argue, thankfully in peaceful ways, over them all the time.

Good book, nothing groundbreaking if you follow the channel. Simple style
