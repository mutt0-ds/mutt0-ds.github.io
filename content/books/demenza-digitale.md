A book that makes some interesting points about excessive media consumption, but the author comes across as closed minded and jumps too quickly to conclusions.

I was only interested in the experiments on children and how multitasking harms reflexes and attention. I also agree that heavily limiting media for small children helps them grow in a healthy way, and I'll take inspiration from that for the future.

As for the rest, I disagree on the supposed links between violence and video games, on the exaggerated demonization of everything on the Internet (which is distracting, yes), and on TV in general. You do need to watch the hours you lose to media, that much is certain. A quick and not very useful read, but I was interested in hearing a different perspective.
