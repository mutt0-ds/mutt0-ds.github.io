The author, a journalist for La Repubblica, writes in a slightly too novelistic way but effectively; the book kept me hooked for three straight days. The story is interesting, and it explores the girls' points of view and the calls they exchanged...

Well, it is sad. Everyone knew this story, but no one spoke about it, since it was not in their interest. It saddened me to read such venal and materialistic talk from those girls, and the brusque and cowardly words of the protagonists. It is interesting to learn more.
