Recommended by Mr. Rip. A collection of about a hundred "summaries" of Tim Ferriss podcasts. Here is the list of the "titans": https://lnkd.in/eTspr9cH

That said, Ferriss often comes across as boastful. I skip most of the health section; it leans into tech-bro self-optimization. Many of the interviewees are excellent, from Arnold to Thiel, lots of impressive people. It is a collection of maxims. Ferriss's interjections can be intrusive. He seems to be a decent person overall, but the persona feels self-important, especially now with investing. Still, it is a solid book thanks to the guests, a collection of lines and thoughts that stick and make you think. Better than 100 hours of that podcast. I also like that each guest gets brief questions with recommendations (often other books). A good format.

It will leave me with some good quotes, the sense that Ferriss is not for me, and not much else. Long, pleasant read.

## Notes

- The superheroes we picture, the titans, are always people with flaws who have maximized one or two specific areas. Humans are imperfect. You do not succeed by having no weaknesses.
- Lessons from Siddhartha
  - "I can think" -> Having good rules for decision-making, and having good questions you can ask yourself and others.
  - "I can wait" -> Being able to plan long-term, play the long game, and not misallocate your resources.
  - "I can fast" -> Being able to withstand difficulties and disaster.
- I should try 30-60 seconds of cold shower. Cold exposure seems beneficial.
- The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life. Ask the right questions.
- Exercises -> Skipped.
- Low Carb diet -> Skipped.
- You can recognize a good doctor by how much time they spend on the first visit.
- Calm is contagious (from a SEAL trainer).
- People are good, but you have to go first. GO FIRST. Put yourself out there. You will not be disappointed.
- The body remembers pain. Slightly changing the movement does the trick if you have chronic pain.
- Floyd Mayweather: 'Why would I be wound up? I'm either ready or I'm not. Worrying about it right now ain't gonna change a damn thing. Right? Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. I've either done everything I can to be ready for this, or I haven't.'
- 10 minutes of Tetris before bed help you disconnect.
- Make your bed every morning. You have your first achievement of the day.
- Mindfulness -> interesting. I should start reading a few books. Start easy. 3, 4, 5 minutes. It should not be a chore.
- From a former Googler: go to every meeting you can, make yourself visible.
- Andreessen (great guest): look for things outside the consensus. Look ahead.
- Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call 'life' was made up by people that were no smarter than you.
- Always think long term: remember George Lucas, he asked for less money but a percentage of toy sales. He played the long game.
- You can sacrifice quality for a great story... I'll watch shaky camera footage now... so long as it's a great story and I'm engaged. (Pixar)
- The secret is to solve the simplest, easiest, high-value problem.
- In order to move fast, I expect you'll make some foot faults. I'm okay with an error rate of 10 to 20% (times when I would have made a different decision in a given situation) if it means you can move fast.
- A-players do not just accept the strategy you give them. They challenge it.
- If you want to have 10 ideas, try to come up with 20. That way, if you fall short, you should still have at least 10.
- You can 1 become great at one thing, or 2 become good enough at two or more. That makes you stronger.
- The chapter on podcast gear is useful.
- The first version is always bad. Same for your first investor meeting. So go to the first ten you do not care much about.
- The point about star therapy is nice: if you feel anxious, look at the sky and think. You are a tiny dot in the universe worrying about something so small, with little relevance.
- Memento mori: remember that you're going to die. It's a great way to remember to live. "In a blink of an eye, we'll all be gone. 100 years compared to infinity is nothing. I talk to my sister all the time... [I say,] 'Girl, you better start having some fun. We're gonna be gone in a minute. You're gonna look back and say, "Shit, I should have been laughing."'"
- People-pleasing causes harm. You do not give them the feedback they deserve and the dignity of knowing the truth.
- Bad decisions make good stories. Look for the silver lining, or at least consider sharing the dark lining.
- Listen to Cal Newport's podcast, supposed to be very interesting.
- Good question to ask: "What are some of the choices you've made that made you who you are?"
- You do not want mainstream fame, it brings more hassle than anything. What you want is the respect of 2,000-3,000 high-caliber people and you can do anything in life.
- Tell your friends that you're a happy person. Then you'll be forced to conform to it. You'll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person.
- 'There are no adults.' Everyone's making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.
- "What's on the other side of fear?" His answer is always, "Nothing." He elaborates: "People are nervous for no reason, because no one's gonna come out and slap you or beat you up."
