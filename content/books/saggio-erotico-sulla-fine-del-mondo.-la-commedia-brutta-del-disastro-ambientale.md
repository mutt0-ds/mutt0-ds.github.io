Book by Barbascura X about climate change, chosen after hearing him on a podcast. Written in his style, very funny, with a somewhat confusing framing story where a man is stuck in space-time and reads fragments of a two-page piece about our climate problems in 2022.

You can tell he prefers to deliver many small bits of information, and the way they arrive is a bit muddled. Still, I enjoyed it and thought a lot, learning many small things on the topic. I now understand the greenhouse effect, how previous extinctions happened, how many problems we are creating with emissions and plastic, and how hard it is to solve without the help of governments and people pushing for change. I would recommend it to a younger audience.
