Very famous book, recommended on Reddit. [The famous photo alone](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/voyager-1s-pale-blue-dot/) is worth the read, and I am curious to philosophize a bit about Earth and how we are tiny specks in the universe. Yet it is such an important speck.

It starts slow, a bit dull at first, but then it gradually drew me in, with stories of possible extraterrestrial civilizations, how we might colonize planets, the traits of each one, the adventures of space missions. Beautiful, poetic, it keeps you engaged. It talks about things far in the future, but it makes you fall in love with space and makes you want to follow the space program. I have a lot of confidence in the future. It is a book that opens up the innate curiosity we have.

Favorite parts? When it talks about possible colonization, and the story of each planet, how we gradually discovered surprising features about atmosphere, pressure, colors, and mysteries.
