What struck me most was the calculation implying that we will have to work much more than our parents, because we will live much longer. Planning a career, staying up to date and adaptable, is essential. Various ideas, with their respective phases (entrepreneurial, or a rush for a while followed by shifts into more relaxed roles), with a focus on happiness toward the end of a career rather than money. Could prove interesting

## Notes

- The end of the three-phase life (education, employment, retirement). There will be shorter stages, with additional periods of education, and an employment phase that can have many surprises and changes
- Interesting view: they assume that life expectancy will keep growing at the same rate (even if recent studies disagree), and that it will be easy for people to change phases and jobs. The economy will not be very stable
- Inequality issue: income is correlated with life expectancy. We need to consider that
- There are various calculations about savings rates and retirement age. We need to explore them more and understand the right results. Things may change in the future
- Retirement age is an important topic many countries are working on: wealthier populations have fewer children, and there is a risk of having a population composed mostly of older citizens who do not work. That is why the retirement age is increasing with life expectancy
