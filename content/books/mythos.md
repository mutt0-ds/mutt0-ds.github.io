Recommended by Incassaforte, a book of Greek tales starting with the first gods and Titans through to the stories of all the mortals they crossed paths with. Really interesting. I did not know many of the minor gods and stories, and it surprised me to realize how many modern words derive from these myths. A pleasant, light read, recommended for taking a break during the holidays.
