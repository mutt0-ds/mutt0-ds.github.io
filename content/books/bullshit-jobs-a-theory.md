Suggested by Incassaforte, finished in a sleepless night. The book expands on an article in the Canberra Times that struck a chord, opening a Pandora's box about the pointlessness of many office jobs. Graeber is an academic and sometimes writes in a heavy style, but I enjoyed reading the stories of dozens of people venting about their jobs and his sharp observations. 

## Notes

1. Definition of a Bullshit Job: basically, a job that is not needed, as even the current worker admits. They are usually unhappy with the situation, since people need a purpose in life.
2. There are different types: a "goon" put there to prevent damage, roles absorbed into more complex dynamics, people who serve as glue between two departments, etc. There are many cases. Surprisingly, the public and private sectors do not differ much.
3. It should not be like this, at least in theory. Capitalism should lead to efficiency. Instead...
4. Possible solutions: a shorter workweek, greater transparency, and minimum wage.

The ending gets lost in an abstract concept that bored me, but it is still a good read. About 40% of respondents find their own job useless. I feel lucky that mine is pleasant and materially "observable" in terms of results, otherwise I would feel bad as in the past.
