_Rejection, Loneliness, Loss, Guilt, Rumination, Failure, and Low Self-esteem: quick recipes to heal us from these invisible (but painful) wounds_

The summary sheet is very useful; here are the key points.

1. Rejection: various wounds that get infected over time, example David at community college. Remedy: logical counterarguments, remember our positive qualities, desensitize (Caution!).

2. Loneliness: example of an older man at the chess club. Social muscles must be trained; isolating more and more becomes self-defeating. Remedy: remove negativity (no pessimism, give the benefit of the doubt, put yourself out there), analyze what holds you back, shift perspective to the other person, empathize, create opportunities to meet others.

3. Loss & Trauma: various cases, example of a widow who had a safari planned with her husband. Not relevant at the moment. Remedy: revisit when needed; there are various assessments to bring clarity at each step.

4. Guilt: unresolved, survivor, and separation guilt. 3 cases, each different (e.g., cheating on a spouse). Remedy: a script for apologizing (excellent), exercises to forgive yourself (survivor), re-engage in life.

5. Rumination: example of a woman who keeps thinking about her boss; overthinking can ruin your days. Remedy: change perspective (exercises), distract yourself with a specific method, reframe anger by changing the scene in your head to a more logical one, be mindful with friends; avoid excessive venting.

6. Failure: a woman looking for a job self-sabotaged without realizing it, in a loop of failures. Remedy: get real, set clear and realistic goals, focus on factors you control, take responsibility for your actions and your fear, and distract yourself from anxiety (tricks like writing a letter, watching something).

7. Low Self-esteem: interesting here, it explains how insecure people struggle to earn respect, like Bo. Remedy: self-compassion (shift to third person and reflect), identify strengths and build on them (exercise), practice receiving compliments, increase assertiveness, increase self-control.
