The book tackles the issues involved in understanding what risk actually is in our decisions, especially in medicine and finance. It starts well, but toward the end it drags into a long critique of the U.S. system. Still, it has some worthwhile key points.

## Notes

- Relative risk (+100%) vs. absolute risk (from 1 to 2 per thousand): big difference.
- Example: 9/11, fear of flying but cars are much more deadly. The risk we perceive is often shaped, and those who market medications know it well.
- Risk and uncertainty apply to different situations; we often try to treat things whose probabilities we do not know as "risk" (example: the turkey that does not know about Thanksgiving).
- Error culture: huge waste because people do not trust intuition (which they use a lot and is often more convenient than complicated rules), but they must "explain" their choices.
- Defensive choices are common: a doctor might recommend an unnecessary test to avoid risk.
- Screening and misleading advertising: when not needed, screening often harms.
- In finance, simple thumb rules are often much more effective than complex methods, which still fail (remember the euro-USD forecast charts, they often miss).
- Fear of risk is social. We usually fear what our peers fear (e.g., guns in the U.S.).
- In the end, after a long analysis of errors in medicine and finance, the gist is that you often do not need complicated models or convoluted decisions: trust the rules of thumb you adopt. Here are Gerd's:
    - Always ask for the reference class: Percent of what?
    - Always ask: What is the absolute risk increase?
    - Find the most important reason and ignore the rest.
    - Ask Your Doctors What They Would Do, Not What They Recommend.
    - Choose the alternative that avoids the worst outcome.
