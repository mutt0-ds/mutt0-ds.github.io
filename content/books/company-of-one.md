Recommended by a Gitbar guest for those who work solo

It is a book about companies that want to pause growth and, instead of expanding, focus on their niche to become the best. The author's experience is quite interesting. The key is to start small, without too much overhead or investment, focus on a niche and do it well, staying current and flexible.

## Notes

- Set profit limits (enough to live well), not generic growth
- Reach a specific audience, and do it in your style
- Focus on getting a small profit right away, then scale over time if it gains traction. If not, move on
- Having a team can be complicated; in your case you can use external freelancers
- It is not for everyone: being solo means taking on many responsibilities
- The usual: add a personal touch, keep marketing genuine
- Various examples of businesses and freelancers who have succeeded

Honestly it did not leave a strong impression. I may have read it during a somewhat busy period. A decent read, but it did not add much.
