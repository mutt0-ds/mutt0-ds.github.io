Another one by du Sautoy, after The Music of the Primes. I did not enjoy it. Basic, with few interesting insights, and it comes across as detached while trying to simplify a trendy topic. The book covers recent developments in AI, from Deep Blue to Watson, ELIZA, and the usual topics. Being pre-ChatGPT, it loses much of its relevance, especially when it discusses Markov chains and maybe GPT-2.

A few nice takeaways are the history of early artificial intelligences, which can help in many fields from math to art, and the ethical questions about who is doing the thinking, the AI or the human. And that we will very likely coexist, each being important to the other.
