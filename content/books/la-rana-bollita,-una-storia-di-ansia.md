I read it in one sitting; it opened my eyes to how irrational and truly unbearable anxiety can be. The story is about an extreme case of anxiety, she does a great job explaining what was going on in her head, conveying how heavy it can become.

I saw a strong distrust of doctors, who could not help her with a psychological problem, and the psychologists were not particularly effective either.

She had burnout with crises (because anxiety affects the back, breathing, and heart), so she took a few months off, first resting at home, then focusing on things that made her feel better: yoga, jogging, writing (this book, I imagine)... Now she is better; she has learned to live with it.

I was struck by how things I take for granted can become feats because of anxiety, and I would like to be like her husband: present, ready to support her during such a difficult time. A bit slow toward the end, but that is fine.
