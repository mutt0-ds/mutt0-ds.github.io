The son of Mel Brooks, he also wrote World War Z, an entertaining book on how to survive a zombie apocalypse.

This one is quite serious. It describes in great detail zombies as hosts of a virus that makes them technically dead but still moving, and the only way to kill them is to cut off their heads and set them on fire.

The book is a very practical manual on how to survive. From weapons (better a precise rifle for headshots and a sword or blade for decapitation; most of the rest is usually pointless) to sheltering and preparation. It is better to barricade yourself at home at first, and after a few days look for some large defense like a prison or a fort to endure the long term.

There are also many fictional zombie stories that give the narrative a certain tone, and it is enjoyable. Precise, technical, yet it keeps you hooked.

Good little book; taken as a survival manual, it has its merits.
