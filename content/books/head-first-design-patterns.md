I loved the book's style, simple and fun even though it dealt with Java and complex topics. I did get a bit lost with Proxies. Each chapter introduces a design pattern and a few principles, guiding me through various use cases. 

What stood out to me the most: the first chapter about ducks, which introduces Strategy and the idea of programming to classes; then the factory pattern that creates more precise copies starting from a prototype; the observer (constantly notified in case of change); and the Singleton, which seems fairly pointless to me but ensures that an object is created only once.

It is a complicated world, but at least I have solid material!
