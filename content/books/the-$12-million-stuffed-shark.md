Suggested by Vittorio of Too Big To Fail podcast, about how the contemporary art world works. I had a great time at the Pompidou and have low expectations; they say it is an easy read. Let's see.

Really, really good! Very fun to read, it explains very well how that world works. Long but never boring, I learned a lot about the field and discovered some wild works. In short, auction houses run the show, people buy art for social status, it is a poor investment and the prices are ridiculous. And it made me laugh. A long book but easy to digest, I rarely get this into something so far outside my area of interest!
