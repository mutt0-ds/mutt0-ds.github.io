Masterpiece. Beautiful storytelling, and the shifts in perspective among the various characters are impressive. From the politician to the soldier to the young person to the improvised hero, the reports from different parts of the world are a clear example of show don't tell. It grabs you at every moment, with its mini-stories. I enjoyed it a lot, and you can tell there is a lot of research behind it.
