Recommended by a Gitbar guest, with great examples of data structures without getting lost in code or pseudocode.

Nice short book. I liked the large number of practical examples, and it is definitely the style I enjoy. The author introduces data structures (int, float, char, array, objects, trees, graphs) very well, and explains some classic algorithms like binary search, bubble sort, and so on.

I found the concepts of byte, Big O, and allocated memory very useful, and also queue and deque. I still learned a bit of something new.

It feels quite amateurish at the end, when it gets lost explaining diagrams and more abstract project-management topics. I did not understand much there. Nothing special, but I like the style.
