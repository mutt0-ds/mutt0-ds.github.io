It merits a reflection on youth. Excellent. Short, sharp, and with a good dose of irony about young people who do not communicate and live in a world of their own; I understand how the author feels. The ending is beautiful, where the son, after many requests, climbs the mountain with his father and finds himself happy in nature. A light read that still makes you think about how generations change, with plenty of humor. I particularly appreciated the parody of Abercrombie & Fitch, which is now decidedly out of fashion. We were so naive.
