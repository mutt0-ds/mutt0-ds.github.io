Recommended on Reddit. A substantial book. It explains why veganism is beneficial for us physically and morally, for animals, and for the environment; how there are no major physical drawbacks; and it addresses the injustices and fallacies of anti-vegan arguments. Very well written, measured and objective, with nearly half the book consisting of references and cited facts. It made me think seriously about changing my diet, perhaps gradually. Close to a 5. It could use a bit more distinctive voice to stand out, perhaps more detail on the meat industry. Still highly recommended.

## Notes

- Core argument: it is a moral question. Do I want an animal to be killed for my food? How do I feel about that?
- Plants do not have a central nervous system. They do not feel pain. Animals respond to situations; plants react. Equating the two suggests it is the same to cut a head of broccoli as to cut a pig's throat.
- In the end, we are saying our satisfaction is more important than moral consideration.
- Debunking the claim that we thrived because of meat consumption: there is no evidence or clear connection.
- Our relationship with animals is broken; we see them as objects to dominate. There is no such thing as happy subjugation, nor a more "humane" killing.
- The conditions for pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, and others are dire.
- Free range is largely misleading: they have little space and only brief outdoor access.
- 26% of the world's surface is used for pasture and 83% of agricultural land, but only 18% of calories and 37% of protein come from it. Switching to a plant-based diet could free up 75% of agricultural land and generate much more food.
- When we eat, what we choose matters more than buying local. Plant-based is still more sustainable, because an animal consumes at least 20 times the resources of the plant equivalent.
- Emissions were reduced by making cows larger, so fewer cows were needed and emissions decreased.
- Does soy drive Amazon deforestation? 75-80% of soy is used as animal feed.
- The oceans: fishing kills billions of fish and disrupts ecosystems.
- Striking chapter on diseases. There is a real concern about a major animal-borne pandemic that we might not be able to treat.
- The British Dietetic Association confirms what the science says: a plant-based diet is compatible with a healthy life.
- The world's five Blue Zones (including part of Sardinia), where people live longer on average, have diets that are about 95% plant-based.
- Protein? No problem: legumes, soy, whole foods, nuts, seeds, broccoli, peas, seitan.
- Iron? No problem: even if absorption is slower, it is in chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, soy, tofu, tempeh, whole foods, legumes, and dried fruit.
- B12? Supplement it. About 40% of people are low anyway. And around 70% of the world takes supplements, so it is not unusual. It does not make sense to see this as a limitation.
- It supports health by reducing many chronic diseases (with research cited).
- On the propaganda: the hypocrisy of showing cute young animals on farms who will then be slaughtered.
- We pay not to see and not to care about what is on our plate. If we had to kill the animal ourselves? If slaughterhouses had glass walls, the world would be vegan.
- Language matters: calling animals "livestock" desensitizes us. In general, there has been lobbying to change the words.
- Excellent guidance on how to talk about this. Expect knee-jerk reactions because people feel judged. That is normal. What they might be experiencing is a complicated reflection of the doubt they feel in that moment.
- Vegans are caught between being branded as extremists or having to endure
- The point is not to force your view, but to work together to understand each other's views. Remember that your counterpart will base their opinion of veganism on the conversation with you. So listen and be cordial, not militant.
- More detail on taxes and subsidies that go to livestock producers would help; we can raise awareness about this. We can do our part.
