Recommended by Alexey Guzey as one of his favorite books, and it has great humor. I have to say the read was engaging, a 4-star for the author's humor (same vibe as Uncanny Valley) as he pokes fun, with solid satire, at the UN's machinery, which at the time was operating in Iraq for the Food-for-Oil program.

In short, the story is that Saddam's regime sold oil to a roster of companies and trusted figures, who took a cut to resell it at a higher price worldwide, giving a portion back (kickback) to Iraq. This was in exchange for food, medicine, and equipment for the population, though the money in truth did not reach them. A gigantic scandal that the UN never properly monitored, due to huge inefficiencies and conflicts of interest, especially around Pasha, who was complicit and the protagonist's mentor.

I recommend the read to see that bodies like this have their own problems. The story is compelling, but overall I felt disheartened to know that entire nations pursued their own interests, sometimes scheming to lift sanctions on Iraq and take its oil, instead of actually caring about locals. I mostly sympathized with the Kurds, who were also selling oil beyond their borders. I would not work in that world: too much bureaucracy, turf wars, and erratic people.
