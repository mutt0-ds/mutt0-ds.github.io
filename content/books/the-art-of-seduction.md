Another recommendation I picked up via Mr. Rip, let's see how it goes.

Still, a long and dull book. It is saved by its references to many figures from history and fiction, from Casanova to Warhol, and their methods.

The points are simple: know the various personalities you meet; everyone has a void to fill, try to create it. Suspense, intrigue, creating a distorted world and strong emotions are key. A deep analysis is necessary to choose the best strategy.

I got little out of it; I skipped the end, it was long and monotonous. I suspect I am not the target audience.
