Some call it one of the best books of the year (as noted by a recruiter on LinkedIn). Biography of Matthew McConaughey.

A beautiful book; it helped me discover a great deal about a deeply spiritual man who has done it all, from playing the bongos and getting arrested to wrestling with an opponent in Africa to wild, Oscar-worthy improvisations. A bold Texan with a lively, unconventional family, and what stories, and what a personality. A very accomplished actor.

His philosophy, in addition to an African/Catholic spirituality, is very much about living on the road and doing good. It is also about following his own path. It inspired me, also because in difficult moments (he wants to change the kind of films he makes, or he wants a role in the Grisham film), opportunity comes his way, or he creates it: the green light.

A fine book, drawn from his journals, very intimate and personal. He seems to have made the most of these 50 years; I hope he continues.
