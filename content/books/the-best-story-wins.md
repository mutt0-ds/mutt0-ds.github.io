A book on Pixar-style storytelling, recommended by a colleague and written by a Pixar director. A worthwhile read before the new role.

Enjoyable and simple. The author is clearly good at storytelling and uses one thread throughout the book: his father's toy store, drawing constant parallels to illustrate key points. It stuck with me.

## Notes

The point is that we humans retain about 5% of the content in an hour of narration. If a narrative includes a story, we remember much more. A story has a stable opening, a disruption, the character's growth, and an ending. There are structures like antagonists, allies, and so on.

The book also covers Pixar's history, which is fascinating. I did not know it came so close to bankruptcy, or how revolutionary Toy Story was at the time.

Matthew's points focus on how to find and build a story. Following classic patterns helps, and you also need something specific to grab attention right away (e.g., the giant bear in the shop).

Other notes:

- Attention span: a story boosts it significantly. Use "The Hook".
- We ultimately make decisions with our emotions. A story speaks to that.
- To create an attention-grabbing hook, "What if" scenarios help. For example: "What if toys could talk?"
- Example of grabbing attention: a businessman with a dented laptop. When he shows it, he has a strong story to tell about great customer service.
- Visual hooks are essential. Use figures that are recognizable and concrete.
- The protagonist must grow and change, perhaps showing vulnerability to build empathy, then facing those weaknesses.
- Do not tell too many stories. One main story, at most two secondary ones, each with its own structure.
- Know the audience. It needs to connect, so test extensively with reviewers to ensure the story holds them.
- There are universal themes like love, family, courage. Pixar often uses them to reach as wide an audience as possible.
- The key to great stories is not being slick but being honest and sharing what you know and feel. Start with a memory, then build from it. Inside Out comes from the author's experience with his daughter's adolescence.
- Six story stages, from "once upon a time" to "happily ever after", that resolve the problem.
- Remember archetypes: antagonist, protagonist, the basic elements that have worked for millennia.
- Be free to invent. That is Pixar's edge: they propose new, quirky ideas. In many organizations, fear of failure hinders growth (the "faster horses" point attributed to Ford). Innovate.
- Misc writing tips: sketch a plan and draft quickly, go straight to the action, then refine.
