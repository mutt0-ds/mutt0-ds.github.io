Recommended by Alfonso on Gitbar to develop critical thinking, these are the emperor's private reflections. 

I have a hard time with ancient authors; I struggle to follow the tone. I found it tough, though I recognize it's incredible that I can read the words of people who lived 2000 years ago and still find them relevant. Aside from a few aphorisms, I would sum up the Meditations as "in a few years we will all be dead, so what people say and the things that make you anxious no longer matter." And live life that way, fairly carefree. There are other, more structured thoughts, but they are really hard to follow; I wasn't at my best. I do like the view that "everything is relative; in the vastness of history, what troubles us matters little"; I'll keep that for the future.
