Recommended by Too Big to Fail, a book on the various conditions of people with neurological issues, with striking stories. Borrowed from the library, a bit heavy in writing style since it is an older book, but very interesting.

It discusses many unusual conditions in a professional way, from the man who forgot who he was every 10 seconds, to the patient who believed his leg was dead, the one who lost his balance, the one who communicated only through drawings (touching), to the twins who generated prime numbers. The author recounts their stories, the possible causes (at times alcohol or drug abuse, often brain lesions), and the treatments.

I was struck by how often patients are capable and accept the illness, living with it. And by how fragile our brain is. One blow and everything can unravel.
