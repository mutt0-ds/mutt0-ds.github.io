Reworking of Gergely's pre-existing documents, Pragmatic Programmer style, like https://thetechresume.com/A_Good_Tech_Resume.pdf, and see the Table of Contents at https://thetechresume.com/table-of-contents.html

The PDF is truly useful, with takeaways that helped me, such as:

- Remove any fluff meant to beautify it; it should be a minimal, easy-to-understand list
- Referrals are key to getting into the company; reach out to employees on LinkedIn
- Stand out with a clear description of what you did in past roles; focus on your achievements
- Remove photos and personal details; they can create bias
- Put a clear list of technologies you know at the top of the resume
- Many examples of do's and don'ts; use them as references
- Automated tools do not reject you at random; in the end there is always a human reviewer, and you need to impress them in a few seconds
- Tailor it to the company and the role you are applying for
- Keep LinkedIn, blog, Stack Overflow, etc. in good shape

Worth rereading when I look for a job again, with many points to explore and examples from great Software Engineers
