Suggested by a Gitbar guest, a small book to understand when to quit and when to keep going. Very geared toward sales, so lots of good ideas but little substance, still a quick and effective read. The concept is simple: in this era you basically have to be the best in your niche, or be the first to arrive and take most of it, or step aside.

I do not fully agree as a lifestyle; it feels too aggressive and focused on superstars. I am fine with comfortable mediocrity where it fits, but the lesson I take is:

- If something is in the Cul-De-Sac, meaning it has no way out, get out quickly, without sinking into purposeless mediocrity. Do not be afraid to quit when it makes sense
Most people do not become the best because they give in to short-term pain, instead of holding on and reaching the top, which requires time, patience, and sacrifice.

Aside from this brief idea, a fairly generic book.
