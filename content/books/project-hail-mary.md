From the creator of [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)), a science fiction thriller recommended on Hacker News. A brilliant book, with that mix of math and physics that keeps it coherent, and it is written with real flair. I connected with it and felt the tension through some tough moments, and I read it quickly. It kept me engaged, a lot happens.

You can tell it was written by an engineer when the protagonist works through calculation after calculation, and it is great to see how he actually finds ways to save the world and pilot his ship despite the disasters. And (SPOILER) the encounter? Wonderful.

Weir writes well, I will read The Martian too. What a fascinating novel.
