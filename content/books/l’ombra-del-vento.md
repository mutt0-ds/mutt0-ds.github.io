Saw it at Libraccio; it comes highly recommended. I agree: it starts a bit slow and the premise is a little uneven, but it soon becomes very exciting with many mysteries and twists, shifts in perspective, and a strong ending. Recommended. Some storylines were sad, but this kind of drama can be very compelling.
