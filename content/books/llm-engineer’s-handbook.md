Found on LinkedIn; a contact was reading it. It could be very useful for my AI projects at work. It has many practical examples of LLMs in production.

Overall it feels overengineered, gets lost in technical details, and adds unnecessary complexity. It did not engage me. Let's keep things simple. Stopped at one third.
