summary: A good manager communicates and listens

A basic and dull read; at times it even feels AI-assisted. Some comments on GoodReads suggest the same impression.

The few interesting parts are Google's Project Aristotle and Project Oxygen, which outline what makes a good team and a good manager. The usual themes: communication, listening, taking a stance. Thin content, repetitive, a bit dull, with a few generic stories. Not very useful, but at least light. Too basic to be truly useful. I am not giving it one star only because it was readable; if it turns out it leaned heavily on AI, that would be disappointing.
