Picked up after the PowerShell book, which was quite interesting; I'll keep it for breaks.

Not much here, too basic. I admit it explains things well and would be useful to start with, but much of the GUI part is outdated, and the rest is basic. I did pick up a few tips like commit -m, git tag, and git cherry-pick, but I knew most of it. I would recommend it to a beginner, but I think you learn faster on the job.
