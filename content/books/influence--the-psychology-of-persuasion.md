I came across it while working on my high school thesis and it is mentioned in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. It seems very interesting for understanding the mechanisms behind persuasion and manipulation. Let's give it a chance with a fresh mind.

A very simple book; many ideas were picked up in later psychology books, so nothing new for me. I liked the final takeaway: before making a decision, like buying from a salesperson, ask yourself "do I like this choice much more than I expected to?" If yes, I am being manipulated, and I should act accordingly and reason logically.

## Notes
The concepts are the usual ones; there are 6 main methods of manipulation:

1. Reciprocation: like when someone gives something (sample, bracelets) to create a need to reciprocate. Remedy: remember you are not obliged to return the favor, since it is manipulation.
2. Commitment & Consistency: a major point of the book, with the example of Chinese captors having prisoners write essays and gradually gaining their trust. Once someone opens up, given how we work, we are more likely to keep going in that direction. Remedy: ask yourself when it is worth backtracking, and if you want to take on a challenge, tell others so you force yourself to stick with it.
3. Social Proof: we follow the crowd. Often it is a rule of thumb (see venues with more people; they are probably better). Remedy: recognize when someone is forcing this strategy on you; in that case it might not be the best option.
4. Authority: the famous electric shocks experiment, and mentions of scams with police uniforms, etc. Remedy: remember that you are intimidated by authority and use logic even when facing it.
5. Liking: we like attractive people and those similar to us. Remedy: try to adopt a mirroring approach with people to make yourself more similar to them, and notice when the approach is forced.
6. Scarcity: a classic. A scarce good is seen as more valuable. Remedy: remember why you want something, not because of the risk of losing it but because you truly care about it.

In the end, nothing new and the prose is a bit dull. Too bad; had I read it years ago I would have appreciated it much more. Still, these are new and interesting findings.
