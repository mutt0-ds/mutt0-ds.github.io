An old-fashioned book that can feel quite 'materialistic,' at times almost manipulative. Aimed at salespeople and anyone who needs to be persuasive, yet still very useful. 

## Notes

- Do not condemn and do not criticize; take the other person's point of view
- Appreciate the people you spend time with honestly and sincerely; show gratitude
- Make your proposals with enthusiasm: step into their shoes, show interest in common ground
- Take an interest in them: consistent, friendly attention is appreciated
- Smile: it can make a difference, as can a sincere compliment
- The name: repeat the speaker's name often and remember it
- Listen and let them talk about themselves: everyone wants the chance to be heard
- Talk about their interests: for example, Roosevelt would learn about others' interests just so he could discuss them briefly
- Make them feel important. Key. People want to feel important. Speak, listen, research.
