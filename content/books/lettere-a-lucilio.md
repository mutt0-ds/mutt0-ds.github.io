From https://www.nateliason.com/notes/letters-stoic-seneca, his favorite book... and I am intrigued by philosophy. It is many pages so I opted for Eliason's summary.

I have to say it was dull; I did not like Socrates' rhetoric, which is full of small, interesting aphorisms interspersed with verbose prose, though I understand the draw of reading words handed down for millennia and read by great figures in history. You can learn a lot. I would not read it again, and in general I will pass on the classics; they are not for me.

As with all the sophists (especially Epicurus, often cited), the ultimate aim is virtus, the highest ideal. Other interesting ideas are:

- a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Changing your mind, moving around, and switching alliances does not lead to clear definition and wisdom
- Your aim is not to be opposed to the crowd, but to be a better version of it
- Stay with people who will improve you and whom you improve: people grow while they teach
- Remember the things you have learned and look at people both ahead of you and behind you
- "If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according to people's opinions, you will never be rich."
- You will always be dissatisfied, whatever your situation, so get used to a frugal life to truly enjoy its fruits
