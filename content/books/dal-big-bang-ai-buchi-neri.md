summary: With a complete theory we will explain why the universe exists; it would mark the triumph of human reason, for then we would know the mind of God.

One of the most technical books I have read; some passages were hard to follow.

- Theory of relativity and the Big Bang as a singularity
- Quantum theory: the 4 forces, the effort to create a single theory (which should hold at very high energy levels)
- The biggest problem is unifying quantum theory and general relativity. It would explain the universe
- Black holes: what they are and what happens
- Space-time is curved and extremely complex. Entropy, the direction of time
- String theory, which could explain various problems
- Conclusion. By combining relativity and quantum theory, Hawkins hypothesizes a four-dimensional space-time that is finite but without boundaries. The universe is self-sufficient with fixed laws, discussion of the existence of God.
