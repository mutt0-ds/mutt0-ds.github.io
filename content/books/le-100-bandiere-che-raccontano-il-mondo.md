A really nice little book, I finished it in a few days. Surprisingly, the author goes through all the flags and tells their stories, from the American to the British, then the European, Asian, African, and South American ones. There is a digression on those of rebels like ISIS and Hamas, as well as on some from sports like the checkered flag and the Olympic flag.

I do not have much to note, but some stories were fascinating, and I saw that, one way or another, many flags have religious symbols behind them, while many others represent the battles for independence.

A nice light read.
