Home maintenance basics. Suggested on Reddit. It is a good book that helped me understand how plumbing, appliances, a motor, double-pane windows, the boiler, heating, and much more work. In practice I have not used it much because the repair advice was too vague, but at least I know how my house works and I have a basic overview of its components. The diagrams were clear and precise.

I would reread it if needed to figure out what might have gone wrong.
