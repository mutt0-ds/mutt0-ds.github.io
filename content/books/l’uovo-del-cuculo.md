I do not recall who mentioned this story to me first, probably some tech book, but it tells how Cliff Stoll tracked a very skilled hacker who had infiltrated US systems. He once replied on HN to a thread about people hacking Amazon, and he came across as a decent person.

The Italian translation is terrible and hard to read, but the story was solid. I liked how he talked about his private life and alternated it with his investigation at work. He worked incredibly hard while neither the FBI, CIA, NSA, nor others did much. It took months to find the hacker, but it was a very interesting case. Maybe read it in English. Very funny how the tools at disposal were back in the days. Printers and phone lines!
