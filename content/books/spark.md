Recommended by Thomas Frank to show how important it is to work out. A bit basic and dull, the usual approach of using studies to prove the point (exercise is good for both body and mind) to the point that I found it repetitive. 

## Notes

There are some stories of the doctor's patients used as examples, and even a school in Nashville if I recall correctly where students do a lot of PE and perform better academically, as well as being in great shape.

### Chapters

1. Exercise helps the body use energy more efficiently: there are more receptors and, for example, it helps glucose regulation and makes cells stronger. Exposing them to a bit of stress with exercise makes them more resilient
2. Exercise makes you more social
3. Exercise helps calm anxiety
4. Exercise helps you fight depression
5. Exercise helps you focus better (especially in cases of ADHD)
6. Exercise helps you avoid vices/addiction, keeping you mentally occupied instead of smoking, drinking, or doing drugs. The post-exercise serotonin boost is key for this
7. Exercise helps you make better decisions
8. Exercise helps you have fitter kids (the link between inactive mothers and children felt a bit of a stretch to me)
9. Exercise helps you live longer! The story of his grandmother who was very fit thanks to walking is great, and staying in shape is key to reaching old age

All in all I would not recommend this read unless you need motivation to start working out. I also tried exercising in the morning and it was a good idea, very helpful for waking up!
