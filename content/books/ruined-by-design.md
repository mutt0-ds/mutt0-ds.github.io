Recommended by a Gitbar host on AI, it seemed interesting, and I have to say it fits very well with the choices we will have to make on that front. Summary at https://teesche.com/bookshelf/mike_monteiro_ruined_by_design. The book made a strong impression on me on the ethics side, because even if my work does not directly affect people's lives, indirectly the consequences are very relevant. Mike cites famous cases like Cambridge Analytica or Greyball: someone designed them and wrote the code, and that is their responsibility.

The problem is that we designer-creators often do not have a say; we do what we are told to do. The goal of "Ruined By Design" is to push us to oppose unethical requests, and to be the gateways to making the world a better place. We can influence very important decisions. And no, doing nice things after work is not enough.

The book is a bit too political for me and goes hard, without compromise. I understand the author's anger at seeing this situation and no one taking responsibility. I will add that if everyone reasons like the folks on Blind, we are in trouble.

## Notes

- Keep an eye on the long-term consequences of your work on the public
- Social media has damaged the world. See Twitter promoting Trump's toxic tweets that drive engagement. Their existence is built on stoking fights
- Everything in your work should aim to make people happy
- Design is a political act.
- Be careful not to create hidden bias: including minorities should not be done just because, but because different people think in different ways and can contribute. For example, Twitter, founded by only white men, never considered a safety mechanism against abuse, because they would never have imagined it. Now it is too late
- We are not just moving pixels: we are creating complex mechanisms that impact people's lives
- How to fix: the best thing is to stay where you are and turn it into a better place. By saying "no" when needed.
- Create a different, safe environment where everyone feels comfortable and can speak up
- If left to grow, today's monsters will become normal in the future. See the Obama tan-suit scandal vs, a few years later, Trump saying anything
- ⭐ Humility is just lipstick on a pig called fear. [..] My confidence isn't for my benefit or even my boss's benefit, it's for the people's benefit.
- Sometimes you will be excluded from decisions. Keep insisting, keep asking to join key meetings; sooner or later they will let you in. And there you can say "no"
- You can simply say "I don't know" if you do not know something. With confidence. Instead of lying or fumbling, it is the most confident thing you can do
- Understand how much power you hold in your hands. If something does not add up, say NO and stop
- Unionize. On this point the book is very clear. As a group, like what happened at Google, the big players are afraid of us. So if you are struggling with a choice, remember you are not alone
