I could not skip it after how much I liked of We Have No Idea.

Good, not at the level of the previous one, more serious, but still with simple, easy-to-follow explanations. An excellent book I would not reread, but it addressed a range of very interesting questions, from life after death to cloning, time travel, and teleportation. Good for people who ask lots of questions and full of ideas; I did not take many notes, though.
