Generally I wouldn't put a novel here, but it was a fascinating read! Haig tackles the practical challenges of living for 900 years, with a plot that continues across the centuries (I love this structure, I devoured it in 3 days). I'm including it here for the ending, where he makes peace with the present, offering a general life lesson to embrace the present without getting lost in past memories or worries about the future. That part really moved me, very zen.
