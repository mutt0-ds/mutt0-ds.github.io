## ðŸ§  Introduction to Second Brains & Brain Dumping

As I'm working with data all the time, I'm aware of the importance of keeping them in a safe and structured place, where they can be easily accessed when needed, which could be days, weeks or even years in the future. Thus,  organizing my informations, tasks and notes is a key activity in my work (and personal) life. Without a clear system I would feel lost in chaos and my productivity will plunge (also considering that my memory sucks).

I have two brain-related buzzwords for you today: Brain Dumping and Second Brain. The first is a life-saving tecnique which resembles the concept of Data Lake: whenever you receive a new data which you consider even remotely useful, just dump it in a place you can re-edit and categorize later. A typical example is when I have a query or a few lines of code in my editor that helped me with a specific issue and could be useful if it happens in the future. I copy them and paste them in a note in my "_TO_ORGANIZE" folder. When I'm free, usually at the end of the day, I cleanse the note, add some context to the code and put them in the right section of my documentation tool. Some oldschoolers use post-it notes and agendas, I use Second Brains.

> A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we've gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.

These tools, structured like wikis, extend the concept of Brain Dumping by making taking notes, connecting and structuring them a bliss, or in my special-kid case, even a fun activity. The biggest players are Evernote, Notion and Obsidian, all with different characteristics but sharing the same core.

You may already know my deep love for Notion ([valued at 10bln $](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/) by the way), which I use on my daily life and I contribute to the Python library. For starters, I recommend it thanks to its user-friendly UX, and it's the go-to choice for my personal Second Brain. Sometimes I give access to part of my Notion wiki to other people and they immediately catch up with its structure.

At work, for reasons I'll introduce later, my tool is Obsidian.

## Obsidian at work

Unfortunately, Notion stores data on their servers without a self-hosted option and it doesn't work offline, so putting sensitive data in there is out of question. Obsidian, differently, works completely offline (so unless you pay for a Premium service or use a shared directory you can't access its notes from other devices). Technically it's "just" a text editor reading Markdown (a special textual format with a specific syntax for basic customization) files stored in the PC, but in the end you have a minimal and powerful wiki tool at your disposale. Additionally, Obsidian notes have a singular characteristic that makes them particularly suitable in my current environment...

> They are like neurons

Bluntly speaking, Obsidian is literally a second brain. Notes are not necessarily structured in folder (even if I used a pseudo-hyerarchical schema for the sake of simplicity) and they can be interconnected with hyperlinks. This makes exploring and find new links an out-of-world experience. And that's possible by just mentioning the other file between brackets!
Images speak louder than words: here is a typical Obsidian graph view, which you can navigate for visually exploring how notes are linking to each other.

## Why I have chosen Obsidian

My work requires to constantly switch between several big projects, with many meeting and interrumptions, and the periodic tickets to solve. At the same time, I have to keep track to dozens of reports connected several data sources, each one with custom business logics discussed in meeting and tickets and the list goes on... It's a giant web of information, and that's when Obsidian becomes useful.

By linking notes together, I can reconstruct the flow of information and keep track of the entire situation. 
In particular:

- Every meeting links to mentioned projects or open tickets
- Every ticket links to report and data sources notes
- Every data source links to its business logics and other data sources
- Every projects contains the documentation and links to all the related meetings
- Every script links to the ticket or project it has been useful for
- And so on, depending on the case

By using the graph view of Obsidian I can quickly find all the information connected to a single object, and while attending meeting or whenever I gain a new piece of intel I can quickly adopt the "Brain Dumping" strategy and store it in Obsidian. Later in the day I clean the note, link it with the rest and expand the wiki.

## A brief overview

## Outcomes

It's been 3 months already and Obsidian has been a life-changer for multiple times already. I was a bit skeptical at first because of my love for Notion, but the adoption process has been smoothless and my productivity is high (TODO). In particular, it's absolutely incredible how can I immediately look back at past meetings connected to a certain topic
