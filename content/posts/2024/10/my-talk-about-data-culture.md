Last Friday, I took the stage at the **[Power BI Ticino Conference](https://sessionize.com/pbiugiti2024/)** to share one of my favorite projects at Acer: our **Power BI Champions program**.
The idea? Find Early Adopters (people who have a curious approach towards new technologies) and put them on the front line to help us promote Power BI and data culture to the rest of the team.

I never imagined I'd speak at a conference when I started this journey...
But wow - the positive feedback and amazing people I've met make me want to do it again!

For those interested, I've added English notes to my Italian slides - you can check them out in the Figma deck below.

The PowerPoint version will be available soon through the [Power BI Italy User Group](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Power-BI-User-Group-Italy/gh-p/PowerBIUserGroupItaly) (or feel free to DM me for a copy).

Big thanks to the Power BI Italy User Group for organizing and to Acer for sponsoring the event.

See you next time! ðŸ‘‹
