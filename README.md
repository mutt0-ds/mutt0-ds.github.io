# Hey, I'm Davide 👋

I'm a Product Engineer based in **Como**, building awesome products at **[InvestSuite](https://www.investsuite.com/)** (and pushing innovation whenever time allows).

My skillset blends AI, Data Engineering, and classic Software Development, plus a healthy dose of [communication](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/10/my-talk-about-data-culture/) and [psychology](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/09/the-culture-map/).

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking, reading, exploring new tools, or sharing my thoughts through my blog.

I believe in keeping things [simple and human](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2025/03/first-pitch/): writing clearly so ideas connect naturally. That's exactly what you'll find here.

## Other fun facts about me:
- I created a [Microsoft Fabric course with DataCamp](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2025/01/fabric-datacamp-course/). I guess that makes me a teacher somehow!
- Although I'm an introvert, I like to challenge myself socially by participating and speaking at [conferences, meetups](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/10/my-talk-about-data-culture/), and [meetings](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2025/03/first-pitch/).  
- My memory isn't great (😇), so I keep [a huge second brain in Obsidian](https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/02/obsidian-productivity-second-brain/) to store all the info I need.
