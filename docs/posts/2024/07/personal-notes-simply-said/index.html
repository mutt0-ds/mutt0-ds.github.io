          <h1 id="simply-said">Simply Said</h1>
<p>Simply Said is the best communication book I&rsquo;ve recently read. It consdes so much information that it resembles an encyclopedia, and the beatufiul thoing is that its key point is, simply said, &ldquo;focus on others&rdquo;. So, for the others, as you, I ocnsodnere the 19 chapters of this useful guide by Jy Sullivan in an easy-to graps blog post,m which will giver you a general overviwew, and hopegully, th deisre to by it .</p>
<p>At first, I wasn&rsquo;t planning to write an entire article about &ldquo;Simply Said&rdquo; by Jay Sullivan. It looked like a standard communication book, but the more I was exploring its chapters, the more I learned about communicating my thoughts and esprimere myself in a better way. Especially when I&rsquo;m talking about technical topic and I really need to express myself in a clear way.</p>
<p>TODO: continue introduction</p>
<p>Legend:</p>
<p>⭐ Key concept</p>
<p>❓ Minor chapters, not that impactful</p>
<h1 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h1>
<p>The main takeaways of the book if &ldquo;Focus on others&rdquo;. You can create more effective messagers about yourself and your ideas when you focus more on the others and less on yourself.
People don&rsquo;t care about YOU, they care about themselves, so when talking to them, you need to make sure to explain why this advantages them and why they should listen. Sullivan is quite repetitive on this, but it always provided practical example to highlight the importance of its dogma</p>
<p>5 parts, each with its own 🔑
Part 1 covers Sullivan’s general tips for making presentations that grab—and keep—the audience’s attention.
Part 2 discusses his tips for effective oral communication; we’ve also included how to apply these ideas to different situations.
Part 3 focuses on improving your written communication in documents and emails.</p>
<h1 id="-section-1-your-content">📌 Section 1: Your Content</h1>
<h2 id="1-conveying-a-clear-message">1. Conveying a Clear Message</h2>
<p>The first chapter introduces the basics for planning a discussion or a talk. Starting from the main message, because most of the times people don&rsquo;t even know what they want to achieve.
Whenever you are participating in a discussion with someone, craft a clear message that you want to stick in your interlocutor&rsquo;s mind. One simple message that respects those rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short (ideally 10 words long)</li>
<li>Using Simple Language</li>
<li>Focused on the needs of audience: what they need to know and do from this information?</li>
</ul>
<p>And a couple of bonus tips:
Remember, it&rsquo;s about them, not you. When beginning a conversation, you can start with what&rsquo;s in front of you for any topic to discuss, and continue the conversation involving the other person.
Another useful tip is when people ask what you do for a living, do not just tell your title, but whgat you do. So, no &ldquo;BI Analyst&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;I design and build strategic reports&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="2-telling-engaging-stories">2. Telling Engaging Stories</h2>
<p>People love stories, stories are the things that get stuck in our mind because it&rsquo;s a pttern that our brain has learned to follow.
So, to convey our messages, doing it as a story will make it 10, 100 times more powerful. Storytelling is a powerful weapon at our disposal.</p>
<p>Sullivan provides example of a successful storytelling, starting from the fact that Every story has a beginning, middle and a end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning: the setup, such us &ldquo;Last week I was in the office&rdquo;: where and when the action happens</li>
<li>Middleç the sturggle, building tension. Only include the crucial details</li>
<li>The end, the final takeaway. It should be a consequence of the middle section, you can even highlight hath the point of the story is this one</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, some ground rules. Do not go negative, do not make fun of other people, don&rsquo;t try to be funny. Unless you are confident in your skills, don&rsquo;t exaggerate.</p>
<h2 id="3-organizing-your-content">3. Organizing Your Content</h2>
<p>Now that you have the message, you have to plan your strategy. There are three aspects to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>The audience&rsquo;s needs</li>
<li>The key message (see Chapter 1)</li>
<li>Your purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point is crucial for getting the attention of the listener. People don&rsquo;t care about you at first, so you need to immediately give them what they are here for.
Example: you have to talk with your boss. You should begin with what you know it will set him in the right mood, e.g. &ldquo;Everything is on track&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have a problem&rdquo;. Set the convertation immediately, then proceed with your message.</p>
<p>For longer discussions, such a presentation, Sullivan provides a couple of structural architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Informative Roadmap: classic structure with Context, Agenda, Topic 1,2,3, FInal Summary and Next Steps</li>
<li>Persuasive Roadmap: used for convincing someone, it uses Context, Recommendation (key message first!), Benefit, Prove Benefit 1,2,3, Final Summary and Next Steps</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: focus on the key message first, not the opening. That&rsquo;s what the presentation is all about and will help overcome the writer block</p>
<h1 id="-section-2-oral-communication-skills">🗣 Section 2: Oral Communication Skills</h1>
<h2 id="4-making-the-most-of-your-body-language-">4. Making the Most of Your Body Language (⭐)</h2>
<p>Most people are afraid of &ldquo;public speaking&rdquo;, but every conversation is public! We always talk with sometone. The secret of this book is that you should trait Public Speaking just like a normal conversation between you and someone else, and you normally don&rsquo;t have fear with that.</p>
<p>The key is to be PRESENT to your audience: people who listen to you wnat to know that they have your attention. So, first of all, be focused on THEM anmd don&rsquo;t look distracted or disconnected. How?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eye contact: do not scan your audience, your brain can&rsquo;t process so many information while talking and you risk panicking or confusing. ⭐ Make eye contact to one person at a time for a complete sentence, 5,7 seconds. In general, it takes less energy to be nice to everyones than to figure our to whom you have to be nice to. So, looking at all the people in the room in the eye, one by one, slowly, will have several benefits.It will calm you, it will avoid distractions, and you build rapport with the audience as they see you interested in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice:
Slow Down. When nervous, people speak faster, making the audience feel overwhelmend.
Volume: your goal is to be heard by people even at the end of the room: ask for feedback about the volume
Tone: smile: your tone will sound more optimistic, even at the phone
Inflection: your voice should punctuate the important ideas you want to convey. Avoid the up-speak tone that sounds like a question, use sharp, clear definitive hand gestures to express yourself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body Language:
Hands: keep them at their place, if you keep them moving you will look nervous or distracted. If you have a PC or notepace, keep the hands on there. Leverage gestures: you can&rsquo;t almost never be too diastracting with gesatures, they are grwat weays to convey attention
Face: SMILE. You should look like you want to meet your counterpart
Stance: keep a neutral, balanced stance. avoid closed body (negative feeling=, keep a neutral stance to aovid misunderstandings. When seating, our energy sghoulkd be directed across the tablò, so don&rsquo;t sit all theway back in the char, your risk being misperceived as diosenaged and bored. Keep the spine vertical.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5-listening-to-understand-">5. Listening to Understand (⭐)</h2>
<p>Again, the focus is on the others, not us. How can we focus? By listening!
Listening well takes energy, and we need to show to the counterpart that we are well attentive and we care about what they say. Being a good listener ism ranked as the number 1 skill for a top leader.
Eye contact, taking notes, asking probing questions, even the standard &ldquo;mhh mhh&rdquo; are all body language clues of someone who is interested in the conversation.</p>
<p>But listening is not only for the others, but for you, because you listen, and in gneeral, ask things to people to search infomrations you didn&rsquo;t even know you didn&rsquo;t know. to get this, you can leveverage open-ended questions like &ldquo;How&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why&rdquo; that ask the other person to reflect and give a complex response, or closed-ended questions that require just a yes/no sand receive a very precise response. Usually, giving closed-ended question is a closing tecnique in sales situations, but be aware to not self-censor yourself with questions like &ldquo;Any other challenges with this issue?&rdquo;: in this case, it&rsquo;s very easy to just say no. Use the open ended alternative like &ldquo;What other challenges you see?&rdquo;. This will help you drilling down until you reach what you didn&rsquo;t even klnow you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Another final point is that our job is to help people, so after having listened to them, we need to make sure we are truly helpful. ⭐ 3 ways on how to be helpful to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can I help? The basic to show you listened and you want to give support</li>
<li>What would be most helpful to you? A very effective way to receive some genuine and precise feedbacks from the other person</li>
<li>Would it be helpful if I&hellip;? If someone is lost, this can give him/her some clues about what could be the next step</li>
</ol>
<p>We all make assumptions: to confirm what you have heard, reinstate the cocnept with an introductory phrase such as &ldquo;So, if I&rsquo;m hearing you correctly&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve shared&rdquo;, a restatement of the point made and a confirming question like &ldquo;am I right&rdquo;? This will avoid confusion.</p>
<h2 id="6-delivering-from-notes-and-visuals-">6. Delivering from Notes and Visuals (⭐)</h2>
<p>When using notes or a presentation, your main job is to make it effortless for your adueicne to recieve the information. The strategy to keep the attention high is always eye contact, so you can follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>See it: look a the bullet point in the slide and read it all</li>
<li>Save it: remember the content as you look up from the notes</li>
<li>Say it: say the point when looking at an individual in the audience</li>
</ol>
<p>⭐ The Arc of Silence: the arc is the distance from the eyes of someone in the audience you are targeting back to the point you are reading and back again to another pair of eyes. Don&rsquo;t talk during that arc. ALL SOUND IS DELIVERED TO A PAIR OF EYES.ù</p>
<p>This has the beneift of maitaning the power by coming across as comfortable with pauses, give time to the audience to digest what you have said, and then giving space to your line beforee sharing the most important information (which we usually place until the end of the sentence).</p>
<p>PAy attention to the posture: use gestures to directly point to your points, stand with your back parallel to the back wall of the room: all the attnetion will be to the audience! Keep your feet planted in one spot, only pros walk around the stage.</p>
<p>About slides: the trick sullivan says is to read back what&rsquo;s on the slide to the audience, and then add what&rsquo;s NOT on each point. If it&rsquo;s a list of 3 bullet points, you can use the Arc of Silence, read each point, add more context, go to the second point, add second context, and go on. You need to cover everything, and of course keep all the points simple. We read every word in the slide is usually a bad sign, but if you do like that, you will fix everything in the memory of please as they have two inpouts: voice and visual, saying the same thing.</p>
<p>Balancing your slide deck can be challenging: opt for a streamlined presentation and provide a more detailed slide deck as a handout afterward. You can&rsquo;t have a highly detailed document and a compelling presentation simultaneously; it&rsquo;s essential to separate the two.</p>
<h2 id="7-responding-to-questions-">7. Responding to Questions (❓)</h2>
<p>When someone asks a question, they are revealing something about themselves and their perspective on the topic. It takes courage to do this, especially in large audiences. Show respect and follow this four-step process to respond:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen to the entire question: allow the person to finish their question without interrupting.</li>
<li>Gain time to think: maintain eye contact but take a moment to gather your thoughts. You can buy time by repeating the question or using a lead-in like &ldquo;Great question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Interesting&rdquo;. Avoid this if the question is an accusation or very direct, as it may seem insincere</li>
<li>Answer and reaffirm the main pont</li>
<li>Ask for the next question: conclude with &ldquo;Any other questions?&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="-section-3-your-written-communication-skills">✍ Section 3: Your Written Communication Skills</h1>
<h2 id="8-editing-for-clarity">8. Editing for Clarity</h2>
<p>Always ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the reader reading this document?</li>
<li>What does the reader need to do with the information I&rsquo;m sharing?</li>
<li>How can I make it effortless for the reader to get the main message?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art: get straight to the point. Eliminate unnecessary words, the so-called &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; words who do not add value to a sentence like &ldquo;Currently&rdquo; or &ldquo;As previously mentioned&rdquo;.
General rule: each sentece should contain one idea. From then, decided what the key action is in the sentence and make it the verb, if it&rsquo;s an istance of the verb &ldquo;be&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s not astate, try to find a verb to convery the action. E.g. &ldquo;he made a statement that he was quitting the race&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;he stated that he was quitting the race&rdquo;.</p>
<p>About active or passive: usually you should use the active form which is catchier, unless for special cases in which you want to soften ascribing accoutnability to someone (e.g. &ldquo;your request has been denied&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;we denied you permission&rdquo;) or establish a sense of high authority (e.g. rules).</p>
<h2 id="9-structuring-your-documents-">9. Structuring your Documents (❓)</h2>
<p>WHy are you writing this document? Focus on the benefits of taking your recommended course of action. You might have two different purposes, with their correspondant document structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Persuading -&gt; State Main Message, Give Background (only as few as needed), Expand Message, End Quickly</li>
<li>Informing: -&gt; Introduce Subject, State Topics, Explain Each Topic in Detail, Summarize</li>
</ol>
<p>These frameworks align with the concepts discussed in Chapter 3.</p>
<h2 id="10-creating-reader-friendly-documents">10. Creating Reader-Friendly Documents</h2>
<p>Beyond the structure, here is a miscellanus of tips to make your docs even more reader-friendly</p>
<ol>
<li>Pronouns: if you find a lof of sentences with I, chances are you are making the document more about you than the reader</li>
<li>Maximum 17 words per sentneces. Over that limit, it&rsquo;s harder to process the information</li>
<li>Vary the sentence length: if it takes 20 words for that line, it&rsquo;s fine. just make sure the next paragraph is less than 10 words.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overwhelm the reader. Structure the document in smaller chunks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11-writing-emails-that-resonate-">11. Writing Emails That Resonate (❓)</h2>
<p>Some email tips that can be useful: structure the email starting from the title. It should convey the topic of the email, like &ldquo;Alpha Proposal for Compliance&rdquo;, not generic &ldquo;Follow Up Call&rdquo;. By starting with the name, .e.g. &ldquo;Dear Lisa&rdquo;, you can figure out the person you are speaking with, and better process how to structure the mail. Different people expect different emails.</p>
<p>Also, manage expectations: clearly indicate a deadline if it exists and mention the people you are referring to if there are multiple destinatairs.</p>
<h1 id="-section-4-your-interactions">🤝 Section 4: Your Interactions</h1>
<h2 id="12-conducting-effective-client-meetings-">12. Conducting Effective Client Meetings (❓)</h2>
<p>Your main objective should always be simply to learn. Leanr the client&rsquo;s concerns. Your only agenda is to meet the client&rsquo;s agemda. In the end, you are in busienss to solve otyher people&rsquo;s problems. So you should be very ecxtied to heaer what&rsquo;s keepin g them up at night andthen say &ldquo;let&rsquo;s work on this and get it done&rdquo;. In a meeting, you shopuld first set this positive tone, then confirm the goal of the meeting, gather as much information as you need (remember chapter 5: especially what you didn&rsquo;t you uu didnt&rsquo; know), discussing the information and the beneidts of your proposal, and establish action steps. A standard meeting structure, in the end.</p>
<p>Tip: take meetign notes or have someone sharing them afterward: you have to maintain the focus and don&rsquo;t forget anything.</p>
<h2 id="13-delegating-successfully">13. Delegating Successfully</h2>
<p>The most significant step we take in our growth is when we move from managign ourselves to managing others. With this change, not only we manage our deadlines and changes and struggle,s but multiply them for all the people under you. Sullivan shares information on how the be an effective boss: you need to be effective at work, not nice. This still means to follow the mantra of the book, focus on others, not yourself. If you delegate an assignment, it&rsquo;s not about what you need, it&rsquo;s about what the other person needs in order to give you want you want. There are 6 steps on how to delegate successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li>State the Big Picture: let the person who is working on an item know how important it will be. We all want our work to matter</li>
<li>Determine Expectations: talk with the other person, clearlyt state what you want her to do</li>
<li>Explain the Role of Others: given an overview of the stakeholders and the people that can support the person</li>
<li>Explain the Reasons for Selecting This individual: Including the benefits to Him or her.</li>
<li>Explain the Next Steps: how to get started and the overall initial structure of things to do</li>
<li>Summarize What you Want the Person to Do</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="14-sharing-meaningful-feedback-">14. Sharing Meaningful Feedback (❓)</h2>
<p>Every time we convey to someone how he has performed on a task, we have not only an opportunity to develop that person professinally, but to build a relationship that says &ldquo;my jos it help you grow&rdquo;. The tone of the conversation conveys that point. A huge struggle of many professionals is tht they don&rsquo;t receive feedbacks: be the people they need, a good feedback is always welcomed if addresed with the right way. Personally, this chapoter could have been more developed, going down with effective feedback examples, instead of a generic framwors.,</p>
<p>Top-quality feedback is delivered consnsitently,. with clear epxectation on both sides about the purpose of the conversation. Framework to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should raise a specific issue</li>
<li>ask of course before sharing the feedbadk
3,. givign the big pciture
4,. identifying success and challenges,</li>
<li>Solve the problem together</li>
<li>Estabish the clear next steps</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="15-giving-toasts">15. Giving Toasts</h2>
<p>Very underrated chapter, but a toast is a unique setting. You are speaking in from of a crowd, but the real audience is only a person. You are telling the room the value he has brought there. Some simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fake it if you don&rsquo;t know the person very well, nobody expects that. Just thank the person for his or her service</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t talk about you.</li>
<li>Avoid inside jokes if less than half of the audience can get them</li>
<li>Never go negative and avoid sarcasm</li>
<li>Remember that the theme is always how this person has impacted organization and their people</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="16-handling-introductions-">16. Handling Introductions (❓)</h2>
<p>Simple chapter about introducing other people to the audiences. It&rsquo;s important to prime themn in from of the audience, but you still have to keep it short, since they will be the focus. Be original, make it personal by selecting 2or 3 attributes of the speaker that will be useful on todays discussion.</p>
<h2 id="17-facilitating-brainstorming-meetings">17. Facilitating Brainstorming Meetings</h2>
<p>Things you should do when coordinating brainstorming sessions, to guide your team in finding the right idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facilitate the discussion with a scribe to capture ideas (ideally you ,stting in a blackboard writing down the points)</li>
<li>Statett he problem clearly</li>
<li>Number the ideas, numbers encourange going on</li>
<li>Prohibit criticism, which may stop other ideas flowing in</li>
<li>Use wall space, ideally with a big panel wqhere to show all the results of the session</li>
<li>Limit session to 1h, afterwards the quality decreases notably</li>
<li>Transcribe ideas and distribute quickly</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="-section-5-your-leadership">🦸‍♂️ Section 5: Your Leadership</h1>
<h2 id="18-leading-others">18. Leading Others</h2>
<p>This is regarding the next stage of your career, where you lead your people. Many managers have thie rown plan and framework, and all of them are fine since they worked from them. But what you absolutely need is a group of followers, without other opeople, you only have nothign b ut potential. Leadership is, in the end, the ability to connect with them inspire them , guide them. Again, it&rsquo;s not about you. You have to communicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your values: define them. Whether your statement of values focuses on itnegrity or valor or street smarts or anything else, you must about to phrase your values about others. Go on the audience perspective, e.g. &ldquo;I believe in work-life balance&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;you deserve a healthy balance and to see your kids on more than just the weekend&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your vision: broarder than a set of actions, bur more concrete of a vague statement of ideas. Sullivan mentions the SMART framework to evaluate your goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your plan: how will your reach your goal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your actions: as a leader, what you will do will heavily influence the others. You have to give a good example to have others follow you, as they compare the words you said with what you ewffectively do</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="19-showing-vulnerability">19. Showing Vulnerability</h2>
<p>To lead, we must instill confidence in others, which comes from an inner sense of self-respect and self-awareness. And part of this confidens comes from showing your genuine self, which may admit to failures, embrace chance, show anxieties. We often fear of being exposed, but i ntruth, we don&rsquo;t have to worrry about that. We already are. No one thinks we are perfect, certainly not those with whom we work closely. Be free to amdit whern you are wrong or you don&rsquo;t know something. ANother fear is the one of ebing rejected: but the more other popel know the &ldquo;authentic you&rdquo;, the more likely they are to realize that, as a complete person, you aren&rsquo;t that different rom how they are. Rejection is less likely if they arelay kjnow your true self-.</p>
