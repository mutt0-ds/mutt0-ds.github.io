      <description>I want to express my gratitude for the positive feedbacks I received a few months ago when I used Google Maps data to determine the best times for the daily commute. TL;DR: Mondays are the best, while Wednesdays, and early Fridays are the trickiest times to hit the road.&#xA;However, the neatness of this analysis takes a hit when real-world unpredictabilities come into play. Things like heavy traffic, rain, road closures due to accidents, or just that one slow driver in front of you can disrupt even the best-planned routes.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite the journey since I first delved into Second Brain technologies for organizing my team&amp;rsquo;s documentation. I previously shared my initial experiences with Obsidian, and now, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a comprehensive update. In case you missed my earlier exploration, you can catch up here.&#xA;So, what has changed? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in. Since my last update, I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to utilize Obsidian for secure and structured note organization within my team, enjoying the rapid and intuitive process and enjoying its advantages (flexibility, powerful search system, security, and so on).</description>

      <description>When my commute buddy and I find ourselves stuck in traffic during our car journeys, we often daydream about finding the ideal route and the optimal time to leave the office in order to avoid these uncomfortable situations. Now, thanks to the power of technology and the inspiration I drew from a fantastic article by @hishamsajid113, I am finally able to back up my theories about the best departure times from home and simulate with real data!</description>

      <description>This is a fun story, with a series of technologies and topics that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe they were capable of living together&amp;hellip; EDM, TikTok, Text-To-Speech, AI, Playwright&amp;hellip; Many times, when going down this over-engineered rabbit hole, I thought, &amp;ldquo;OK, I have to write about this thing.&amp;rdquo; And also, &amp;ldquo;What am I doing here with my time?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;ðŸ“š Some context So, here are a few key things to be aware of:</description>

      <description>There is something bizarre with me if two of my favourite activities are writing documentation and hitting my head against tests, which are notoriously unexciting activities for many developers ðŸ˜«&#xA;Luckily, we are all unique in our own way and I decided to contribute to the testing module of one of my favorite libraries, notion-sdk-py.&#xA;Being a certified Notion user, I use its Web App on a daily basis, and the Python library helps me automatically organize my notes.</description>

      <title>My Personal Airflow - How I&#39;m monitoring my scripts with Python, Appsmith and SQL Server</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the story of how I created my first full-stack project for monitoring my daily activities, using Python and SQL Server in backend and Appsmith for the GUI. I have a lot to learn and process yet, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&#xA;ðŸ˜Ÿ The Problem There are scripts I&amp;rsquo;m using that are particularly tedious to monitor. The typical structure is the following:&#xA;Load data (from a file or manual input) Send a request to internal DB / very specific API Compare the data received with the input and if something is wrong, notify me or a colleague.</description>

      <description>Well, my GF&amp;rsquo;s tastes in memes are simple: she loves wholesome memes and, most importantly, she loves animals.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why I created a fun little project that:&#xA;Surfs the subreddit r/wholesomemes using the reddit API Downloads a few of the hottest memes in the contents folder Initializes a ResNet50 model that recognizes images containing any animal Sends them via mail to my GF (positively welcomed) Final email (3 memes by default) Reddit I&amp;rsquo;m using the praw library for downloading the memes, it requires a Reddit Bot enabled.</description>
