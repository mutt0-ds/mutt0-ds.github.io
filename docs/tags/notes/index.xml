      <description>üß† Introduction to Second Brains &amp;amp; Brain Dumping As I&amp;rsquo;m working with data all the time, I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the importance of keeping it in a safe and structured place, where it can be easily accessed when needed, which could be days, weeks or even years in the future. Thus, organizing my information, tasks, and notes is a key activity in my work (and personal) life. Without a clear system, I would feel lost in chaos, and my productivity would plunge (also considering that my memory sucks).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: this will be a long, long post, written in my own way.

At my new workplace I‚Äôm going to use PowerBI and DAX a lot, thus my boss suggested me to read the book.&#xA;Yep, it is big and very technical, with 700+ pages rich in contents, but trust me, that‚Äôs the ‚ÄúBible‚Äù, a must-read for anyone willing to work with PowerBI and DAX.</description>
