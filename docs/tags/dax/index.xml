      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-this-measurecolumn-work&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How does this MEASURE/COLUMN work?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most frequent requests I was receiving. And it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In complex Power BI models, users often struggle to understand the meaning of specific measures or columns. This is especially true for ambiguous names like &lt;code&gt;AMSLast12m&lt;/code&gt; or columns with deep business logic such as &lt;code&gt;NetAmount&lt;/code&gt;. How is it calculated? With VAT? Without it? Help!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, there were limited options: ask a colleague, guess the logic, search documentation, or simply try your luck and add it blindly to the report. None of these are ideal solutions, particularly for those new to report creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Notes about The Definitive Guide to DAX</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this will be a long, long post, written in my own way. It’s essentially a dump of my personal notes, taken when reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlbi.com/books/the-definitive-guide-to-dax-2nd-edition/&#34;&gt;“The Definitive Guide to DAX”&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;strong&gt;Alberto Ferrari&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Marco Russo&lt;/strong&gt;. At my new workplace I’m going to use PowerBI and DAX a lot, thus my boss suggested me to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yep, it is big and very technical, with 700+ pages rich in contents, but trust me, that’s the “Bible”, a must-read for anyone willing to work with PowerBI and DAX. There’s everything you need, from the basics commands to the most advanced functions, with complex topics such as context transition, query plan, and storage engine. Many examples, in addition, apart from explaining every concept introduced in the book (which focuses a lot on giving clear, practical explanations) explore edge cases that gave me lots of headaches in the past. Further examples and insights can be found on the authors’ site &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlbi.com/&#34;&gt;SQLBI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
