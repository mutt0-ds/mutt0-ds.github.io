      <description>Today I want to show you a very useful trick that we are using for automatically describing our measures and calculated columns in Power BI. A big problem we had in the past, and source of constant requests from our most advanced users (the one who were connecting live to the Power BI datasets and creating their own small reports) is &amp;ldquo;How does this MEASURE work?&amp;rdquo;. In case of legacy columns with 10 variants, or the ones with complex business logic involved, this was quite a frequent cause of confusion.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: this will be a long, long post, written in my own way. It’s essentially a dump of my personal notes, taken when reading “The Definitive Guide to DAX” written by Alberto Ferrari and Marco Russo. At my new workplace I’m going to use PowerBI and DAX a lot, thus my boss suggested me to read the book.&#xA;Yep, it is big and very technical, with 700+ pages rich in contents, but trust me, that’s the “Bible”, a must-read for anyone willing to work with PowerBI and DAX.</description>
