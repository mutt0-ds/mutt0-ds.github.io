      <description>Last Friday, I took the stage at the Power BI Ticino Conference to share one of my favorite projects at Acer: our Power BI Champions program. The idea? Find Early Adopters (people who have a curious approach towards new technologies) and put them on the front line to help us promote Power BI and data culture to the rest of the team.&#xA;I never imagined I&amp;rsquo;d speak at a conference when I started this journey&amp;hellip; But wow - the positive feedback and amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve met make me want to do it again!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Simply Said&amp;rdquo; is the best communication book I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently. I discovered it thanks to Jordan Cutler (who runs an amazing tech newsletter) and at first, I considered it a standard communications book. Things like &amp;ldquo;listen to others,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;be positive,&amp;rdquo; blah blah.&#xA;I was wrong. &amp;ldquo;Simply Said&amp;rdquo; is much more than that. That&amp;rsquo;s why I condensed most of its wisdom into this blog post, and I hope it will inspire you to read it as well.</description>

      <description>Presentation Patterns Written by Neal Ford, Matthew McCullough and Nathaniel Schutta, &amp;ldquo;Presentation Patterns - Techniques for Crafting Better Presentations&amp;rdquo; is an encyclopedia of patterns, tips and common mistakes experienced by the authors, who have delivered thousands of presentations. In particular, they introduce â€œNo Fluff, Just Stuffâ€œ, a traveling technical conference series covering a wide variety of topics related to software development and management.&#xA;During the years, they have build up their toolbox of patterns to provide killer presentations, which are divided in three main sections: Prepare (thinking and setting up the presentationâ€™s key concepts), Build (creating the slides), Deliver (present the content).</description>
