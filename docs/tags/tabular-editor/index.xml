      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-this-measurecolumn-work&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How does this MEASURE/COLUMN work?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most frequent requests I was receiving. And it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In complex Power BI models, users often struggle to understand the meaning of specific measures or columns. This is especially true for ambiguous names like &lt;code&gt;AMSLast12m&lt;/code&gt; or columns with deep business logic such as &lt;code&gt;NetAmount&lt;/code&gt;. How is it calculated? With VAT? Without it? Help!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, there were limited options: ask a colleague, guess the logic, search documentation, or simply try your luck and add it blindly to the report. None of these are ideal solutions, particularly for those new to report creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying issues I have when working with Power BI files is that source control is a real pain.&#xA;Considering that Microsoft owns Azure, Github, and Power BI, one would hope that they will come up with a solution for comparing two reports without using third-party tools or overly complicated solutions&amp;hellip; But that day seems still far in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a story about how I managed to set up a CI/CD pipeline through Azure DevOps Pipeline for providing rudimental version control of our Power BI reports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
