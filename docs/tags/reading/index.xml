      <description>&lt;p&gt;My relationship with physics has always been… troubled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably because I had a high school teacher who never managed to spark any interest in me, I just never caught up. I remember sitting silently at my final exam (Maturità) when the physics question came up, completely blank. I also struggled like hell with the physics exam at university. It just never clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And honestly, I don’t deal with physics in my daily life, so the chance to change that never really came up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
