And for good reasons, as it’s a very big deal for us engineers, working with data every day.
In short, Fabric is a cutting-edge, unified data platform that merges lots of tools together, starting from a common Data Lake where data can be stored (OneLake), and a suite of new tools on top of it that are integrated in the “fabric” of Fabric.</description>
