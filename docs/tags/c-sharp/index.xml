      <description>&amp;ldquo;How does this MEASURE/COLUMN work?&amp;rdquo; This is one of the most frequent requests I was receiving. And it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why.&#xA;In complex Power BI models, users often struggle to understand the meaning of specific measures or columns. This is especially true for ambiguous names like AMSLast12m or columns with deep business logic such as NetAmount. How is it calculated? With VAT? Without it? Help!&#xA;Traditionally, there were limited options: ask a colleague, guess the logic, search documentation, or simply try your luck and add it blindly to the report.</description>
