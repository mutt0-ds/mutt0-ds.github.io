      <description>Last Friday, I took the stage at the Power BI Ticino Conference to share one of my favorite projects at Acer: our Power BI Champions program. The idea? Find Early Adopters (people who have a curious approach towards new technologies) and put them on the front line to help us promote Power BI and data culture to the rest of the team.&#xA;I never imagined I&amp;rsquo;d speak at a conference when I started this journey&amp;hellip; But wow - the positive feedback and amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve met make me want to do it again!</description>

      <description>Cultures can be very different One of my favorite lessons in my international master&amp;rsquo;s course was about cultural differences. I remember our instructor showing us funny videos of different cultures interacting. There was an American asking an Indian colleague if they&amp;rsquo;ll meet next week&amp;rsquo;s deadline. The response, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can do&amp;rdquo; could mean either &amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no way&amp;rdquo; depending on the cultural context. Needless to add that the American was very confused when the deadline wasn&amp;rsquo;t met the week after.</description>
