      <description>ðŸ§  Breaking Down Full Stack Development This post has been sitting in my drafts for over 7 months. Why? First, the project I created has been under discussion for production deployment at my company, so I need to keep certain details vague. Second, there was so much content to cover that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack, so I&amp;rsquo;m splitting this into at least two parts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back with another post, this time exploring a new CSS framework, Tailwind CSS!&#xA;In the previous months I started using Angular and Typescript for some small web apps and dashboards, but I always found CSS management cumbersome. I could spend hours tweaking font-size and align-items parameters and hard-coding variables, and this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of fun.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to try Tailwind, which is being heavily recommended by many people in the frontend community!</description>
