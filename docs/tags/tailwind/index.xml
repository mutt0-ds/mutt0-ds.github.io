      <description>🧠 Introduction to Second Brains &amp;amp; Brain Dumping I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite silent in the past months, but there was quite a big reason for doing so: I was studying, a lot. This time I decided to dive again into fullstack web development, but instead of my past, smaller experiments of one page, I wanted to build a functional web app including Database, ORM, Authentication and Excel integration.&#xA;I already worked on smaller projects, but this &amp;ldquo;secret misssion&amp;rdquo; was going to be inspired by a legacy tool for Forecasting, I had the chance to study.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back with another post, this time exploring a new CSS framework, Tailwind CSS!&#xA;In the previous months I started using Angular and Typescript for some small web apps and dashboards, but I always found CSS management cumbersome. I could spend hours tweaking font-size and align-items parameters and hard-coding variables, and this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of fun.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to try Tailwind, which is being heavily recommended by many people in the frontend community!</description>
