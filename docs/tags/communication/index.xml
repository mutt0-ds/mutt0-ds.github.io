      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had my first technical presentation at my new company.&#xA;I joined InvestSuite 3 months ago and it was finally time to present the product I’m working on, StoryTeller, to a very important customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve given many presentations in the past (to hundreds of people, even at a conference) so this wasn’t entirely new to me. But I’m shy by nature, and presenting doesn’t come easily to me. This time, it felt different because the stakes were higher: it was about selling our product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cultures-can-be-very-different&#34;&gt;Cultures can be very different&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite lessons in my international master&amp;rsquo;s course was about &lt;strong&gt;cultural differences&lt;/strong&gt;. I remember our instructor showing us funny videos of different cultures interacting. There was an American asking an Indian colleague if they&amp;rsquo;ll meet next week&amp;rsquo;s deadline. The response, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can do&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; could mean either &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;no way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; depending on the cultural context. Needless to add that the American was very confused when the deadline wasn&amp;rsquo;t met the week after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Notes about Simply Said</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Said-Communicating-Better-Beyond/dp/1119285283&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simply Said&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the best communication book I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently.&#xA;I discovered it thanks to Jordan Cutler (who runs an &lt;a href=&#34;https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/&#34;&gt;amazing tech newsletter&lt;/a&gt;) and at first, I considered it a standard communications book. Things like &amp;ldquo;listen to others,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;be positive,&amp;rdquo; blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was wrong. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simply Said&amp;rdquo; is much more than that&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why I condensed most of its wisdom into this blog post, and I hope it will inspire you to read it as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
