      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had my first technical presentation at my new company.&#xA;I joined InvestSuite 3 months ago and it was finally time to present the product Iâ€™m working on, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investsuite.com/storyteller&#34;&gt;StoryTeller&lt;/a&gt;, to a very important customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve given many presentations in the past (to hundreds of people, even at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/10/my-talk-about-data-culture/&#34;&gt;a conference&lt;/a&gt;) so this wasnâ€™t entirely new to me. But Iâ€™m shy by nature, and presenting doesnâ€™t come easily to me. This time, it felt different because the stakes were higher: &lt;strong&gt;it was about selling our product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, I took the stage at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sessionize.com/pbiugiti2024/&#34;&gt;Power BI Ticino Conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to share one of my favorite projects at Acer: our &lt;strong&gt;Power BI Champions program&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;The idea? Find Early Adopters (people who have a curious approach towards new technologies) and put them on the front line to help us promote Power BI and data culture to the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never imagined I&amp;rsquo;d speak at a conference when I started this journey&amp;hellip;&#xA;But wow - the positive feedback and amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve met make me want to do it again!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
