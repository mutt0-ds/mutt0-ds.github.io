      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had my first technical presentation at my new company.&#xA;I joined InvestSuite 3 months ago and it was finally time to present the product I’m working on, StoryTeller, to a very important customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve given many presentations in the past (to hundreds of people, even at a conference) so this wasn’t entirely new to me. But I’m shy by nature, and presenting doesn’t come easily to me. This time, it felt different because the stakes were higher: it was about selling our product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
