      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had my first technical presentation at my new company.&#xA;I joined InvestSuite 3 months ago and it was finally time to present the product I’m working on, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investsuite.com/storyteller&#34;&gt;StoryTeller&lt;/a&gt;, to a very important customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve given many presentations in the past (to hundreds of people, even at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/10/my-talk-about-data-culture/&#34;&gt;a conference&lt;/a&gt;) so this wasn’t entirely new to me. But I’m shy by nature, and presenting doesn’t come easily to me. This time, it felt different because the stakes were higher: &lt;strong&gt;it was about selling our product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
