    <p>The book is fine, with a set of tools meant to help decision makers in a fast-evolving environment (he was at Uber), but I read it in bits between breaks at work, paying little attention. I did not get as much out of it; it felt a bit too abstract and conceptual. By comparison The Phoenix Project is much more pragmatic. The Pragmatic Engineer took excellent notes: <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/an-elegant-puzzle-book-review/">https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/an-elegant-puzzle-book-review/</a></p>
<h2 id="chapters">Chapters</h2>
<h3 id="organizations-topics-on-organization-and-team-design">Organizations: topics on organization and team design</h3>
<p>Interesting that in a system evolving this quickly, like Uber, scaling and changing systems every few months is the norm. The migration process is fundamental. Be flexible, with the awareness that as you grow you will need to retire systems.</p>
<h3 id="tools-systems-thinking-and-tools-to-manage-change-at-the-org-team-and-individual-level">Tools: systems thinking and tools to manage change at the org, team and individual level</h3>
<p>Nothing stood out to me except presenting to executives, which is very important to be heard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There absolutely is not a single right way to present to senior leaders, but hopefully, the template is a useful starting point.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Tie topic to business value.</li>
<li>Establish historical narrative. One or two sentences to answer the question &ldquo;Why should anyone care?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Explicit ask. What are you looking from the audience? One or two sentences.</li>
<li>Data driven diagnosis. (&hellip;)</li>
<li>Decision making principles.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s next and when it will be done.</li>
<li>Return to explicit ask. (&hellip;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Also very useful: how to present to the press and the model, document, share approach</p>
<h3 id="approaches-common-but-difficult-situations-engineering-managers-often-find-themselves-in-and-dealing-with-these">Approaches: common, but difficult situations engineering managers often find themselves in and dealing with these</h3>
<p>Nothing particularly useful to me, maybe Saying No but basic</p>
<h3 id="culture-efforts-that-can-shift-the-culture-within-an-organization">Culture: efforts that can shift the culture within an organization</h3>
<p>Useful advice: befriend your colleagues; a tight-knit team works very well. Also, do not overwork yourself; remember that the people who will remember you working late in 20 years will be your children</p>
<h3 id="careers-hiring-evaluating-performance-promoting-and-retaining-people">Careers: hiring, evaluating performance, promoting and retaining people</h3>
<p>Content on how to hire, and how to hire fast. It did not resonate much with me, aside from the idea of a funnel and how evaluating performance is very delicate</p>
<h3 id="appendix-tools-to-operate-an-organization-at-the-line-manager-middle-manager-and-manager-of-managers-level-as-well-as-the-reading-list">Appendix: tools to operate an organization at the line manager, middle manager, and manager of managers level, as well as the reading list.</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Line management</dt>
<dd>
<p>Around the time your team reaches three engineers, you&rsquo;ll want to be running a sprint process. There are many successful ways to run sprints, try a few and see what resonates for you. (&hellip;)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Middle management</p>
<p>As you move into middle management, you&rsquo;ll become responsible for two to five line managers, and will need to shift away from day-to-day execution to give your line managers room to make an impact (and free yourself up to make a larger impact as well). (&hellip;)</p>
<p>Managing an organization</p>
<p>As your organization starts to get even larger and you&rsquo;re mostly managing middle managers, the playbook shifts again. (&hellip;) Along the way, remember that your old problems still exist, it&rsquo;s just that other folks are dealing with them instead. As you roll out new processes to solve your personal pain points, you should be handing off processes to your managers, and keeping them intact and running.</p>
<h2 id="snippets-taken-from-the-book-raw">Snippets taken from the book (raw)</h2>
<p>Teams are slotted into a continuum of four states:</p>
<ul>
<li>A team is falling behind if each week their backlog is longer than
it was the week before. Typically, people are working extremely
hard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your
users are vocally dissatisfied.
A team is treading water if they&rsquo;re able to get their critical work
done, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or
begin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are
still working hard, and your users may seem happier because
they&rsquo;ve learned that asking for help won&rsquo;t go anywhere.
A team is repaying debt when they&rsquo;re able to start paying down
technical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt
repayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more
time to repay more debt.
2.2.2</li>
<li>A team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably
low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user
needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, if you don&rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your
career. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-
covering the same patch. Don&rsquo;t go there. Go somewhere that&rsquo;s
disproportionately valuable to you because of who you are and
what you want</p>
<p>Finally, the one thing that I&rsquo;ve found at companies with very few
interruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really
great, consistently available documentation. It&rsquo;s probably even
harder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting
company than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing
company, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I&rsquo;ve seen
is a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a
documentation search that actually works.
There are a non-zero number of companies that do internal
documentation well, but I&rsquo;m less sure if there are a non-zero
number of companies with more than 20 engineers that do this
well. If you know any, please let me know so that I can pick their
brains.</p>
<p>Your first reaction might be to confront this head-on, but it takes
a while to build credibility after starting a new job. Sure, you&rsquo;ve
been hired for your experience, so they respect your judgment,
but it&rsquo;s a hard sell to convince someone that your personal
experience should invalidate their personal experience.
I&rsquo;ve been trying something different.
Model. Start measuring your team&rsquo;s health (maybe using short,
monthly surveys) and your team&rsquo;s throughput (do some
lightweight form of task sizing, even if you just do it informally
with a senior engineer on the team or with yourself), which will
allow you to establish the baseline before your change.
Then just start running kanban. Don&rsquo;t publicize it, don&rsquo;t make a
big deal about it, just start doing it with your team. Frame it as a
short experiment with the team, and start trying it. Keep iterating
on it until you&rsquo;re confident it works. Have the courage to keep at it
for a while, and also the courage to stop doing it if it doesn&rsquo;t work
after a month or two. Use the team&rsquo;s health and throughput
metrics to ground your decision about whether it&rsquo;s working.
Document. After you&rsquo;ve discovered an effective approach,
document the problem you set out to solve, the learning process
you went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. Be as detailed as possible:
make a canonical document, and even get a few folks on other
teams to check that it&rsquo;s readable from their perspective.
Share. The final step is to share your documented approach,
along with your experience doing the rollout, in a short email.
Don&rsquo;t ask everyone to adopt the practice, don&rsquo;t lobby for change,
just present the approach and your experience following it.
You&rsquo;ll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that
work effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting
how you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to
change their approach.
Strangely, in my experience, this has often led to more adoption
than top-down mandates have</p>
<p>It took me a few years to glean a lesson from that experience, but
it comes to mind frequently now when I work with folks who are
just starting to present to executives. Giving a presentation to
senior leadership is a bit of a dark art: it takes a while to master,
and most people who do it well can&rsquo;t quite articulate how they do
it. Worse yet, many people who are excellent rely on advantages
that resist replication: charisma, quick wit, deep subject matter
expertise, or years of experience. Start with the conclusion. Particularly in written
communication, folks skim until they get bored and then stop
reading. Accommodate this behavior by starting with what&rsquo;s
important, instead of building toward it gradually.
Frame why the topic matters. Typically, you&rsquo;ll be presenting on
an area that you&rsquo;re intimately familiar with, and it&rsquo;s probably very
obvious to you why the work matters. This will be much less
obvious to folks who don&rsquo;t think about the area as often. Start by
explaining why your work matters to the company.
Everyone loves a narrative. Another aspect of framing the topic
is providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and
where you&rsquo;re going now. This should be a sentence or two along
the lines of, &ldquo;Last year, we had trouble closing several important
customers due to concerns about our scalability. We identified
our databases as our constraints to scaling, and since then our
focus has been moving to a new sharding model that enables
horizontal scaling. That&rsquo;s going well, and we expect to finish in Answer directly. Senior leaders tend to be indirectly responsible
for wide areas, and frequently pierce into areas to debug
problems. Their experience &ldquo;debug piercing&rdquo; tunes their radar for
evasive answers, and you don&rsquo;t want to be a blip on that screen.
Instead of hiding problems, use them as an opportunity to explain
your plans to address them.
Deep in the data. You should be deep enough in your data that
you can use it to answer unexpected questions. This means
spending time exploring the data, and the most common way to
do that is to run a thorough goal-setting exercise.
Derive actions from principles. One of your aims is to provide a
mental model of how you view the topic, allowing folks to get
familiar with how you make decisions. Showing you are &ldquo;in the
data&rdquo; is part of this. The other aspect is defining the guiding
principles you&rsquo;re using to approach decisions.
Discuss the details. Some executives test presenters by diving
into the details, trying to uncover an area the presenter is
uncomfortable speaking on. You should be familiar with the
details, e.g., project statuses, but I think that it&rsquo;s usually best to
reframe the discussion when you get too far into the details. Try
to pop up to either the data or the principles, which tend to be
more useful conversations.
Prepare a lot; practice a little. If you&rsquo;re presenting to your entire
company, practicing your presentation is time well spent.
Leadership presentations tend to quickly detour, so practice isn&rsquo;t
38
quite as useful. Practice until you&rsquo;re comfortable, but prefer to
prepare instead getting deeper into the data, details, and
principles. As a corollary, if you&rsquo;re knowledgeable in the area
you&rsquo;re responsible for, and have spent time getting comfortable
with the format, over time you&rsquo;ll find that you won&rsquo;t need to
prepare much for these specifically. Rather, whether you&rsquo;re able
to present effectively without much preparation will become a
signal for whether you&rsquo;re keeping up with your span of
responsibility.
Make a clear ask. If you don&rsquo;t go into a meeting with leadership
with a clear goal, your meeting will either go nowhere or go
poorly. Start the meeting by explicitly framing your goal!</p>
<p>This refined list of goals, aligned to your company&rsquo;s priorities,
then becomes a central artifact for how you and your manager
collaborate on your career evolution. Every quarter or so, take
some time to refresh the document and review it together.
If you&rsquo;re unconvinced that it&rsquo;s worth your time to write a career
narrative, you certainly don&rsquo;t have to write one. Most folks get
away with not writing one for their entire career and have deeply
fulfilling careers despite the absence.
That said, if you don&rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your
career. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-
covering the same patch. Don&rsquo;t go there. Go somewhere that&rsquo;s
disproportionately valuable to you because of who you are and
what you want</p>
