The goal is to make sure the agent keeps answering useful questions while not introducing dangerous or undesired behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis becomes critical very quickly. Anyone who has done prompt engineering knows \u003cstrong\u003ehow easy it is to introduce regressions\u003c/strong\u003e. You ask the model to be less verbose, and suddenly it stops explaining important steps or fails scenarios that were previously working.

This usually happens during planning. You then encode that behavior as evals and iterate until the system consistently satisfies them. In that sense, evals act both as a regression safety net and as a specification of how the AI system is supposed to behave. They also work very well as a communication tool, because a list of evals is often clearer than any document when explaining expected behavior to non-technical stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-do-you-measure-an-eval\"\u003eHow do you measure an eval?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a tricky topic and there is no perfect solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a first approach, we used \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance\"\u003eLevenshtein\u003c/a\u003e distance, which measures how close two strings are. It is cheap, deterministic, and good enough to steer development early; think of it as unit tests before integration tests. It obviously does not understand meaning, but it helped us quickly detect when changes were degrading answers across multiple evals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the system became more stable, we introduced \u003cstrong\u003eAI-judged evals\u003c/strong\u003e. In this setup, another LLM evaluates each answer and assigns a score, usually from 1 to 5, based on correctness and effectiveness. This is currently the only realistic way to evaluate non-deterministic behavior at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are trade-offs. This approach is more expensive, adds latency, and introduces another prompt to maintain, since the evaluator itself must be well-defined. Still, the upside is significant, because you can finally assess reasoning quality, tool usage, tone, and completeness, not just surface-level text similarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, we use a mix of both approaches depending on the stage of the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 3161px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2642%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://iframely.net/yzYVKbbJ?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ecredits: Brainstrust\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"which-tools\"\u003eWhich tools?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonest opinion: \u003cstrong\u003eI did not find huge differences between eval tools\u003c/strong\u003e.

For example, I recently noticed that one of our AI tools which accepts a list of inputs was being called five times with one element instead of once with five elements. Thanks to the trace in our Braintrust environment, I could see what was going wrong, fix the prompt, and re-run the evals to ensure behavior was unchanged. It was, and the agent response time became 50% faster — another useful KPI tracked automatically by the tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 2894px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 64.5937%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://iframely.net/vx2LKfdL?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ecredits: Brainstrust\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"so-eval-driven-development\"\u003eSo, eval-driven development?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with TDD, \u003cstrong\u003eI think the truth lies somewhere in the middle\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting immediately from evals can be an exaggeration.

I remember our instructor showing us funny videos of different cultures interacting. There was an American asking an Indian colleague if they\u0026rsquo;ll meet next week\u0026rsquo;s deadline. The response, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e could mean either \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;sure\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;no way\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e depending on the cultural context. Needless to add that the American was very confused when the deadline wasn\u0026rsquo;t met the week after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because India is a high-context culture, where linguistic nuances are the norm. An Indian person won\u0026rsquo;t give us negative feedback directly. Instead, they use varying levels of complex analogies to provide indirect hints on how to improve. Compare this to a low-context Swedish person. He will be more likely to say \u0026ldquo;This system sucks\u0026rdquo; in a blunt and direct way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer on generalizations: It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that we\u0026rsquo;re discussing averages and general tendencies, not stereotypes. The country position on the chart indicates the mid-position of a range of acceptable or appropriate behaviors in that country! Of course, you\u0026rsquo;ll find diverse individuals within any culture. You should always evolve your understanding based on personal interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother example?

In China, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to know the other person, share meals and drinks together. At the opposite, Nordic cultures like America and Germany prefer to focus on tasks. From both perspectives, their approach feels natural, but it\u0026rsquo;s deeply ingrained in their cultural norms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"and-thats-great\"\u003eAnd that’s great!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the fun part: \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0026rsquo;re all different\u003c/strong\u003e, and there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; way to communicate. Each of us has our own style, and each perspective makes sense in its cultural context. In the end it\u0026rsquo;s all about appreciating the rich diversity of human communication and adapting our styles accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always applied these lessons carefully, especially now that I work in a corporation with dozens of different cultures. I was able to connect more naturally and avoid many intercultural oopsie.\nKnowing cultures serves as a shortcut: if I\u0026rsquo;m talking with someone from a low-context culture, I can expect some sharp and direct comments. For a high-context culture, I need to be very careful and read between the lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s take time perception as another example.

Keep your feet planted in one spot; only pros walk around the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout slides: The trick Sullivan suggests is to read what\u0026rsquo;s on the slide to the audience, and then add what\u0026rsquo;s not on each point. If it\u0026rsquo;s a list of three bullet points, use the Arc of Silence, read each point, add more context, go to the second point, add second context, and so on. You need to cover everything, and keep all the points simple. Reading every word on the slide is usually a bad sign, but if you do it like this, you will fix everything in the memory of the audience as they have two inputs: voice and visual, saying the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing your slide deck can be challenging: opt for a streamlined presentation and provide a more detailed slide deck as a handout afterward.

Numbers encourage participants to keep going\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProhibit criticism, as it may stop other ideas from flowing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse wall space, ideally with a big panel, to display all the results of the session\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLimit the session to 1 hour; after that, the quality of ideas tends to decrease significantly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTranscribe ideas and distribute them quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"-section-5-your-leadership\"\u003e🦸‍♂️ Section 5: Your Leadership\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"18-leading-others\"\u003e18. Leading Others\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is regarding the next stage of your career, where you lead your people. Many managers have their own plan and framework, and all of them are fine since they worked from them. But what \u003cstrong\u003eyou absolutely need is a group of followers\u003c/strong\u003e\nWithout other opeople, you only have nothign b ut potential. Leadership is, in the end, the ability to connect with them inspire them, guide them. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not about you. You have to communicate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour values: define them. Whether your statement of values focuses on integrity or courage or street smarts or anything else, you must phrase your values about others. Reframe to the audience\u0026rsquo;s perspective, e.g. \u0026ldquo;I believe in work-life balance\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;you deserve a healthy balance and to see your kids on more than just the weekend\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour vision: broarder than a set of actions, bur more concrete of a vague statement of ideas. Sullivan mentions the \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/smart-goals/#:~:text=This%20framework%20can%20be%20helpful,they%20can%20help%20your%20team.\"\u003eSMART framework\u003c/a\u003e to evaluate your goal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour plan: how will your reach your goal?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour actions: as a leader, what you will do will heavily influence the others. You have to give a good example to have others follow you, as they compare the words you said with what you ewffectively do\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"19-showing-vulnerability\"\u003e19. Showing Vulnerability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo lead, we must instill confidence in others, which comes from an inner sense of self-respect and self-awareness. And \u003cstrong\u003epart of this confidens comes from showing your genuine self\u003c/strong\u003e, which may admit to failures, embrace chance, show anxieties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often fear being exposed, but the reality is, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about that—we already are. No one expects us to be perfect, especially not those we work closely with. It\u0026rsquo;s liberating to admit when we\u0026rsquo;re wrong or unsure about something. Another common fear is rejection: however, the more people understand the authentic you, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll see that you\u0026rsquo;re not fundamentally different from them as a whole person. When others genuinely know who you are, rejection becomes less likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/simply_said/cover.png","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/07/personal-notes-simply-said/","title":"Personal Notes about Simply Said"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eIn recent months, I have been experimenting with AI tools to leverage new, powerful technologies and create value. Like you, I am inundated with hype and buzzwords, and this makes things complicate, when trying to get started. While looking for simple answers to my questions, it’s often challenging to extract real value. So, I want to share my notes to help others with similar needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-business-case-an-ai-analyst\"\u003eMy Business Case: an AI Analyst\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with the big question I had in my mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a big, complex data source (a database, an API). How can I connect it to an AI and be fairly* confident it doesn’t mess things up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Remember, with AI, you can’t be 100% sure of anything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I worked with our order database to create an “AI Analyst\u0026quot; using Azure OpenAI. The goal was to enable it to respond to common questions like, \u003cem\u003e“When is my order arriving?”\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e“What’s the order status for this customer?”\u003c/em\u003e This would save our analysts time and effort since the majority of the questions they receive are always the same..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not talking of the toy databases you find in tutorials with 3 tables and 10 columns, this is a real schema with joins, millions of rows and knowledge of the business logic required. The cool part is that by using tools the AI model won’t care about the complexity underneath: as you’ll see, the possibilities are endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-ai-tools\"\u003eBefore AI Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the “old days” (five months ago, lol), the only way was to use GPT-3.5 to make SQL queries and return a response, specifically with Langchain and a \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/use_cases/sql/\"\u003eSQL\u003c/a\u003e plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also considered making DAX queries to \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/powerbi/\"\u003ePower BI\u003c/a\u003e models. However, AI tends to hallucinate when you add a couple of joins in SQL, and it gets even worse with a language that has only a fraction of the documentation and popularity. Indeed, results were terrible. I remember using several calls for checking and parsing the code, along with multiple retries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-game-changer-tools\"\u003eThe Game Changer: Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, \u003ca href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling\"\u003eOpenAI announced Tools (initially called Function Calling)\u003c/a\u003e. Tools allow the latest AI models (3.5 turbo, 4, 4o) to decide whether calling certain functions when needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like telling to our GPT, \u003ccode\u003e“Reply to my {QUESTION}, knowing that if I ask about the weather, you can use this {FUNCTION} which needs the city and time as input.”\u003c/code\u003e. This is prompt engineering, as I was saying. The OpenAI ChatCompletion API returns a special object for running the tool and then provides the final response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis differs from \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\"\u003eRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\u003c/a\u003e, where you use a specialized Vector database to search your documents (e.g., Copilot with your email inbox), then pass the best results to the prompt and tell the AI to reply based on the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 1536px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/ZRkGzjC\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e different.

However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale well with larger datasets, and manual refreshes are necessary for obtaining the freshest data. It\u0026rsquo;s suitable for small-scale projects but falls short when dealing with larger datasets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"directquery\"\u003eDirectQuery\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery\"\u003eDirectQuery\u003c/a\u003e is interesting.\nThe report\u0026rsquo;s semantic model is just a connector to the original data source (in this case, a database), and every time you interact with your report sends a new query.

The concept is straightforward yet ingenious: one report to serve them all.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works: we import all the data into a report, then publish it in a shared Power BI workspace accessible to users. Daily (and hourly) ETL pipelines handle refreshing the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; report automatically, overseen by data engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this setup, users can \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;live connect\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e to the report and enjoy all the benefits of Import Mode—size, speed, and simplicity—without worrying about refreshing the semantic model, which resides elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a significant drawback is the inability to modify the semantic model directly since it\u0026rsquo;s located elsewhere. Thus, creating new tables and columns (excluding measures) in a live connected report isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. All new changes must be made in the original report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"composite-model\"\u003eComposite Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-composite-models\"\u003eComposite Model\u003c/a\u003e is when you mix together a Live Connection (which becomes a DirectQuery), and something else, either another DirectQuery or a local file in Import Mode.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go too much into details here because it\u0026rsquo;s a new feature, and still has big limitations in my opinion. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned its great potential in a past article, as it can be the Saint Graal for some people who aim to integrate an \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; report with their own local files, but mixing together connection can incredibly deteriorate the query performance, because the model will make several queries before joining the results with the rest of the data. Still, be very cautious with composite models and keep an eye for future updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Composite Model blends a Live Connection (which essentially becomes a DirectQuery) with another DirectQuery or a local file in Import Mode. I won\u0026rsquo;t delve too deeply into the specifics here because it\u0026rsquo;s a relatively new feature with significant limitations, in my opinion. While I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted its potential \u003ca href=\"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/03/what-power-bi-is-missing/\"\u003ein a previous article\u003c/a\u003e, caution is warranted, as mixing connections can severely impact query performance.

This approach combines the speed of Import mode with the live queries of DirectQuery by utilizing well-optimized tables in a Data Lake, offering the best of both worlds.

These tidbits pique my interest or hint at something important, even though I may not fully grasp their significance at the time. They range from random tickets I stumble upon to snippets from meetings, archived documents, scripts or casual coffee chat exchanges. Later, typically at the end of my day when tackling a substantial task isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal, I revisit these notes to organize them properly, adding relationships and moving them in the apposite subfolders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother engaging activity involves exploring the note tree. I enjoy clicking through the dots and uncovering unconnected notes (\u0026ldquo;orphans\u0026rdquo;), re-reading them, and establishing fresh connections or cleaning up outdated entries.

Since the Obsidian vault is just an extensive markdown repository, I\u0026rsquo;ve considered automation possibilities such as generating notes automatically when we receive new tickets, complete with metadata. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on an experimental script to extract text using OCR from PowerPoint and Word files, transforming them into Markdown format through the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Unstructured-IO\"\u003eUnstructured\u003c/a\u003e Python library.

Consequently, Meta\u0026rsquo;s social media platform decided to temporarily remove the option of adding music to posts.

Thus, organizing my information, tasks, and notes is a key activity in my work (and personal) life. Without a clear system, I would feel lost in chaos, and my productivity would plunge (also considering that my memory sucks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I want to introduce you to two buzzwords related to the note taking: \u003cstrong\u003eBrain Dumping\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSecond Brain\u003c/strong\u003e. Brain Dumping is a technique that involves storing as quick as possible any useful data in a safe place, so it can be easily accessed and cleaned later and the brain can avoid worrying about them. For example, if you have a code snippet that helped you solve a problem, you can copy and paste it into a note in your \u0026ldquo;_TO_ORGANIZE\u0026rdquo; folder.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m free, usually at the end of the day, I cleanse the note, add some context to the code, and put them in the right section of my documentation tool. Some old-schoolers use post-it notes and agendas, I use Second Brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we\u0026rsquo;ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.\n\u0026ndash; \u003ccite\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/\"\u003eTiago Forte \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept has given rise to tools like which are strucuted to help take note-taking to the next level.\nThese tools, structured like wikis, extend the concept of Brain Dumping by making taking notes, connecting and structuring them a bliss, or in my special case, even a \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; activity. The biggest players are \u003ca href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\"\u003eRoam Research\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e, all with different characteristics but sharing the same core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I love using Notion for my personal Second Brain because of its user-friendly UX. You may already know my deep love for Notion , which I use on my daily life and I contribute to the Python library. For starters, I recommend it thanks to its user-friendly UX, and it\u0026rsquo;s the go-to choice for my personal Second Brain. Sometimes I give access to part of my Notion wiki to other people and they immediately catch up with its structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for work, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that Obsidian is the way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/notes.png\" alt=\"notes\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-at-work\"\u003e💼 Obsidian at work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Notion stores data on their servers without a self-hosted option and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work offline, so putting sensitive data in there is out of question. Obsidian, differently, works completely offline (so unless you pay for a Premium service or use a shared directory you can\u0026rsquo;t access its notes from other devices). Its notes are \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; Markdown files (a special textual format with a specific syntax for basic customization) stored in the PC, just like .txt documents\u0026hellip; And the program reads them like Notepad, super minimal and lightweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Obsidian notes have a singular characteristic that makes them particularly suitable in my current environment\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are like neurons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put it plainly, Obsidian is literally a second brain. Notes don\u0026rsquo;t have to be structured in a folder and can be interconnected with hyperlinks, which creates an out-of-world experience for exploring and finding new relationships. And all it takes is mentioning the other file between brackets! A picture is worth a thousand words, and here is a typical Obsidian graph view that allows you to visually explore how notes are linked to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/obsidian_graph.png\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_search.gif\" alt=\"graph view 2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-why-i-have-chosen-obsidian\"\u003e☝ Why I have chosen Obsidian\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy job is a constant juggling act of multiple large projects, meetings, tickets, and reports from various data sources. It\u0026rsquo;s a labyrinth of information that\u0026rsquo;s impossible to navigate without getting lost. But then, Obsidian comes to the rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its ability to link notes together, I can map out the entire flow of information and stay on top of everything. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I do it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach meeting is linked to the relevant projects or open tickets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach ticket is linked to the reports and data sources notes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach data source is linked to its business logics and other data sources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach project has documentation and links to all related meetings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach script is linked to the ticket or project it\u0026rsquo;s been useful for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so on, depending on the scenario.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s graph view, I can quickly access all the information connected to a single object. During meetings or whenever I gain new intel, I quickly jot it down using the \u0026ldquo;Brain Dumping\u0026rdquo; strategy and store it in Obsidian. Later, I organize the notes, link them together, and expand the wiki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-a-brief-overview-of-the-structure\"\u003e📁 A brief overview of the structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Obsidian vault is a treasure trove of information that I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to structure in a way that is easy for my colleagues to access. It\u0026rsquo;s a semi-structured schema with high flexiblity as it\u0026rsquo;s not required by Obsidian (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a sort option) that helps to organize the wealth of information that I need to manage every day. With main folders and subfolders, I can easily navigate my way around and find what I need quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a snapshot of my Obsidian vault structure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTO_ORGANIZE\u003c/strong\u003e - this is where I store new notes by default before cleaning them up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDocs\u003c/strong\u003e - where I keep all the important documentation that my team and I need to access quickly.

It\u0026rsquo;s a system that is not only efficient but also visually appealing. I could remove all the folders if I wanted to, but the structure helps to give a familiar feel to other users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-plugins-i-use\"\u003e🔨 Plugins I use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a plethora of options available in the marketplace to enhance the Obsidian experience. While I prefer to keep things streamlined, here are a few plugins that I can wholeheartedly recommend:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003eEditor Syntax Highlight\u003c/a\u003e: exceedingly helpful, especially when dealing with notes containing code snippets. It makes syntax highlighting a breeze, and makes the code much more readable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table\"\u003eExcel to Markdown table\u003c/a\u003e: an absolute lifesaver when you need to copy data from Excel files. It takes care of all the formatting issues, saving you a ton of time and effort.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder\"\u003eIcon Folder\u003c/a\u003e: I love this plugin because it allows me to maintain the same aesthetic I was accustomed to in Notion, where every folder had a corresponding emoji. It\u0026rsquo;s a small touch, but it makes the interface much more enjoyable to use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename\"\u003ePaste Image rename\u003c/a\u003e: If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who frequently pastes screenshots or other images into your notes, then it is an absolute must-have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\"\u003ePaste URL into selection\u003c/a\u003e: another one that replicates the functionality of Notion, and it\u0026rsquo;s a time-saver for me.

It makes minor typographic tweaks (like replacing hyphens with en-dashes), which makes the notes more visually appealing and easier to read.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jdbrice/obsidian-code-block-copy\"\u003eCopy Button for code blocks\u003c/a\u003e: a tiny addition that saves me a ton of time. It adds a copy button to code blocks, so you can quickly copy the code without having to highlight it and use the keyboard shortcut. I can\u0026rsquo;t understand why this functionality isn\u0026rsquo;t already built into Obsidian.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-limitations\"\u003e⛔ Obsidian limitations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, there are some limitations with Obsidian that are impacting my experience. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnfortunately, there is no option to share a note as a public link that can be accessed by others (web or within my organization). While I understand Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s focus on privacy and \u0026ldquo;private notes,\u0026rdquo; I do miss the convenience of being able to easily share a page as a link with a colleague or leave clickable shortcuts to links in a folder like in Notion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe PDF export feature is limited, and there\u0026rsquo;s no way to export notes in bulk. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;d like to automatically upload a PDF of some notes in a folder when I edit them with specific formatting. But unless I start learning \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template\"\u003eLaTeX and pandoc\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m unable to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyntax formatting in code blocks isn\u0026rsquo;t enabled unless you have \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003ean outdated plugin\u003c/a\u003e that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even support DAX (Power BI\u0026rsquo;s script language) formatting. While I\u0026rsquo;m working on a plugin fork to address this issue, it\u0026rsquo;s a tedious process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile the Obsidian team is currently focused on the \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/canvas\"\u003eCanvas feature\u003c/a\u003e, which is a fantastic addition for those who previously used Graph.io and similar software, the frequency and impact of updates are slow due to the team\u0026rsquo;s small size. Thus, I doubt that my previous issues will be addressed quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, I would strongly advise against using Obsidian if you are not fond of its neural structure, especially if your notes are not often interconnected. This is due to the fact that the learning curve can be steep, requiring the mastery of several shortcuts and a certain discipline in maintaining notes. If you neglect to organize your vault, it can quickly become overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that if you\u0026rsquo;re not utilizing connections, you\u0026rsquo;re only tapping into half of Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-first-results\"\u003e🥳 First Results\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been four months since I started using Obsidian, and it has already been a game-changer for me on multiple occasions. Initially, I was skeptical due to my love for Notion, but the adoption process was seamless, and my productivity has definitively increased. The most incredible thing about Obsidian is how I can instantly look back at past meetings connected to a particular topic and explore further, find connections, and expand my knowledge by examining other notes and reconstructing the entire scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn excellent example that I presented in my proposal was a story about a user who raised a question during a brief meeting about an advanced Power BI feature. During the meeting, I took some notes on the issue, then created another note with a guide, and then another note about the following meeting where I introduced the guide. A few days later, I completely forgot where the guide was located, but I remembered the user\u0026rsquo;s happy reaction in the second-grade related note and traced my way back to the valuable document. I use this technique multiple times a day when searching for notes, and it saves me a lot of time piece by piece. Also, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about restructuring notes when a project evolves; I can just link them together and embed updates of the project in a primary super note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_view.gif\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most significant advantage, as mentioned in the introduction, is the ease of the \u0026ldquo;brain dumping\u0026rdquo; process. Whenever I come across new information, I can open Obsidian in one second, create a note with a shortcut, and jot down a few lines to be cleaned up later. My brain is now free to keep listening and learning without worrying about forgetting anything valuable.

Take inspiration from superheroes, where the origin story always raises interest. When presentation attendees recognize the narrative arc, it helps them understand your material because they understand the basic framework and they can follow it in an easier way.

Embrace the change, the majority of the authors is constantly reworking their presentations after each conference! After presenting, remember the things that didn’t convince the public (ideally, you should find someone with brutal honesty and criticism to tell you) and update your work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤼 \u003cstrong\u003eConcurrent Presentation\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you are creating a group presentation, assign a Slide Wrangler who will handle the Master deck and start using the same template so merging pieces won’t be chaotic. If you want to highlight a “TODO” Slide to be enhanced, you can drift out from the template with the ugliest combination of font/colors to draw attention to the issue.

Inside jokes add credibility as they mark you as an insider. Neal Ford calculates one joke every 15 minutes, but don’t make them Alienating Artifacts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤵 \u003cstrong\u003eLeet Grammars\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is an alternative alphabet (aka slang) that you can use to be perceived as part as the audience, an insider.

It synergies with the Narrative Arc pattern, hovewer use it only once. It can be implicit (an hidden detail) or simply a slide with a question and “Stay tuned!”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🏛 \u003cstrong\u003eGreek Chorus (and Posse)\u003c/strong\u003e\nBring friends to the talk to support you and show positive feedbacks, influencing the other participants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧩 \u003cstrong\u003eComposite Animations\u003c/strong\u003e\nFor a unique animation effect that catches the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention, layer two or more animations on top of each other. Don’t overdo it, use it for key slides and only if you know well which animations you should use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍽 \u003cstrong\u003eÁ la Carte Content\u003c/strong\u003e\nAt the beginning of the presentation, you can poll the audience to construct their agenda by choosing what they want to hear between small chunks of content (Talklets). This is a very complex strategy as you need to be extremely prepared to the different scenarios and create additional material\u0026hellip; It works well in case of a presentation you need to share several times with groups with different knowledge levels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📻 \u003cstrong\u003eAnalog Noise\u003c/strong\u003e\nPlace unpolished elements in the presentation to make a key message stand out (e.g. an ugly font for the title of a slide introducing a problem). Don’t overuse the tecnique. Stand out from the overly polished and aesthetic presentations we currently have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🚫 \u003cstrong\u003eDefy Defaults\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t follow the default settings, stand out from the typical presentation style, especially corporate ones which are riddled with antipatterns. Don’t go directly against the rules, but try to apply the patterns you have learned in a subtle way\u0026hellip; For example by using the corporate template when you have to, but then showing your style in the body of the presentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⤴ \u003cstrong\u003eGradual Consistency (and Soft Transitions)\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse many animations to better convey your message. Difficult to explain without examples, the concept is that by making elements move (e.g. “As Is” → animation that kicks it out of the screen → “To Be” fades in) you can tell an animated story, super effective. Personally, I don’t like animations but the pattern can be useful for simple, key concepts. Use it sparsely, the book relies too much on that. Use soft transitions (dissolve, push) to shift delicately from slide to slide.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👻 \u003cstrong\u003eInvisibility\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn case of an audience that has already read the presentation and knows what you are going to talk about. Add an animation that begins with a blank page (and everyone will be focused on what you are talking about as they can’t be distracted), and then show the content. They can’t expect it in the printout: it will be a surprising moment, but in my opinion it’s too showy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👄 \u003cstrong\u003eLipsync\u003c/strong\u003e\n(For Live Demos). Playing live with the tool can be risky, as there are numerous unpredictable issues that can happen. Record yourself before the talk when using the tool and play the video while talking over it or in case of emergency. You can be less stressed, you can skip boring or lengthy moments, you can highlight certain parts. However, you can’t improvise if the audience asks you anything. Suggestion: hide Windows Tray and another unnecessary parts of the screen, as they will distract audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📼 \u003cstrong\u003eLive on Tape\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf travelling issues occur, video-record your presentation like you were live in that same room: this makes the video more natural and engaging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"deliver\"\u003eDeliver\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛹️‍♀️ \u003cstrong\u003ePreparation\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlways be ready for the worst-case scenario. Hard drives can fail, you can come in late, you lose your laptop charger… Prepare your kit in advance the night before and check all the setup (better overdress than not being formal enough), have a backup of the presentation and stay hydrated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤝 \u003cstrong\u003eSeeding Satisfaction\u003c/strong\u003e\nLike Rock Bands that start with an opening act, you can shake hands, chat and warm up the audience before beginning the talk. Even one friendly face can make the difference, so introducing yourself to strangers and making some good impressions can help. It is also convenient to build connection with other people with the same interests and maybe make the expectations they have about you very clear. Don’t push too much if you see hat they don’t want to socialize.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💵 \u003cstrong\u003eDisplay of High Value\u003c/strong\u003e\nBy instinct, the audience consider the speaker as valuable with an high social status and interesting things to say. Use this concept at your advantage, show that you are prepared and comfortable with the situation. Don’t apologize for technical issues, but move on and keep talking. Don’t let other people (Hecklers) hijack your presentation. Don’t look confused when you can’t reply to a question, suggest ways to follow up later instead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔁 \u003cstrong\u003eCarnegie Hall\u003c/strong\u003e\nPractice. Practice.Practice. Present it to your pets first, then to a friendly crowd (friends, colleagues), record yourself if you want to. Trying to repeat it as much as possible forces yourself to get used to talk and to gain confidence and tweak out the small details of the presentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐻 \u003cstrong\u003eEmotional State\u003c/strong\u003e\nTry to understand the overall mood of the people involved, if they are having a good day and how they are feeling.

Embrace silences. When stressed, you tend to speak faster, to fill up every gap and constantly be active, which reveals your nervousness. Plan some tactical breaks during (and before) key moments, pay attention to the rhythm of your voice. Sometimes the author writes a symbol in the notes to remember to breathe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🦶 \u003cstrong\u003eShoeless\u003c/strong\u003e\nAchieve relax with little quirks to help ignoring the stress. Removing shoes may be a bit odd in corporate environments, but the pattern can be extended to everything that makes you more comfortable.

You have to be the mentor of the audience, their guide to a new world they don’t know. They need to feel that you care about it and leave the event enlightened with your wisdom. Preparing a strong Narrative Arc does help.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌧 \u003cstrong\u003eWeatherman\u003c/strong\u003e\nFace the camera like a Weatherman on the news, don’t look at the screen behind you but speak directly to your audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍒 \u003cstrong\u003eSeeding the First Question\u003c/strong\u003e\nUsually the audience is embarrassed to ask the first question, you need to find a way to break the ice. A good idea is to serve an obvious question in your presentation. An idea could be mentioning advanced concepts so people can ask questions about them at the end as they are curious.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛈ \u003cstrong\u003eMake It Rain\u003c/strong\u003e\nMove things around (chairs, props, papers) to make the audience more comfortableç very useful in educational settings, but discouraged in corporate environments.

Don’t overuse it (leave the joke out if in doubt) or there is high risk of alienating the public; also, it should be relevant to your Narrative Arc and pay attention to not offend anyone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🕶 \u003cstrong\u003eThe Stakeout\u003c/strong\u003e\nALWAYS go to the talk earlier to avoid last-minute issues, get familiar with the environment, and, if possible, start chatting with the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔦 \u003cstrong\u003eLightsaber\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse the laser pointer judiciously like a skilled Jedi, highlighting the point of the slide you want to focus on when necessary. It’s not the best way as it attracts the complete attention of the audience, it’s better to use Traveling Highlights, but it gives you more freedom.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔂 \u003cstrong\u003eEcho Chamber\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen someone asks you anything, repeat it back to the audience (paraphrased).

Avoid the handshake image cliché at the end of the presentation, please.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👟 \u003cstrong\u003eBorrowed Shoes\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t present another person’s slides! It is surprisingly difficult to integrate your style with someone else’s one.\n✔ → Rework the initial material into something suitable for you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e☠ \u003cstrong\u003eSlideuments\u003c/strong\u003e\nAnother beloved antipattern from the authors, and a classic in the business world: a presentation that has to be also a document. There’s no free lunch: \u003cstrong\u003eyou can’t have both of them\u003c/strong\u003e!\n✔ → There is no real solution. Check Infodecks for an example of a working system. A workaround could be to create the presentation as usual, keeping it minimal, and then attach a more prosaic document (presentation notes) as .pdf so the audience can read it when looking for documentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💀 \u003cstrong\u003eDead Demo\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt typically happens with Live Demos when the presenter is not prepared and fiddles around with the tool for lack of material or for personal ego. Boring.\n✔ → As said, it is very difficult to nail a Live Demo. Practice a lot (typing in public is way more stressful) and keep it short if you really have to show the tool.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"deliver-1\"\u003eDeliver\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔪 \u003cstrong\u003eShortchanged\u003c/strong\u003e\nSomeone else is still talking when it’s your time for presenting, making you lose precious time.\n✔ → It happens. Don’t feel rushed, don’t let anyone feel that this could be an issue. Be ready to skip some slides or sections. Don’t be afraid to assert yourself and ask the other person to stop the talk by hinting and setting your things up (or even interrupting).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥛 \u003cstrong\u003eHiccup Words\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you pollute your talk with nonwords such as ‘uhm’, ‘oh’, ‘eh’ or overused words such as ‘definitely’, ‘frankly’, ‘actually’. Happens during stressful moments, the brain is more comfortable with these words rather than awkward pauses. Very difficult to identify.\n✔ → Recognize your hiccup words by asking a friend to count them or recording yourself. Try to spot when the antipattern happens and take a breath, or rephrase it into something more articulate like ‘I’ll get to that detail later’. Don’t be afraid to be silent for a second.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔇 \u003cstrong\u003eDisowning Your Topic\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t change your presentation on the fly because you think your audience is not interested.\n✔ → Be prepared and Know Your Audience and this antipattern won’t occur. Remember that social hints may be misleading, and that you can’t please everyone. Just stick to what you have planned to minimize risk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐖 \u003cstrong\u003eLipstick on a Pig\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you try to fix a bad presentation by to making it more aesthetically appealing. The slides are initially good, but your talk doesn’t leave any result in the long run.\n✔ → The authors recommend to set up a solid base before adding lipstick, suggesting “\u003cem\u003eone hour of preparation for every minute of presentation\u003c/em\u003e” (a bit too much in my case 😄). Time is the key, and all the previous pattern about having a clear and meaningful structure in mind.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🗼 \u003cstrong\u003eTower of Babble\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse technical jargon can be effective with the right audience, but can backfire, especially if you are doing it for flaunting your intellect. Difficult to notice if you talk “IT” every day.\n✔ → Know your audience and understand when and how much you can be more technical. For a business audience, stick to a simpler and more practical wording.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e☢ \u003cstrong\u003eBunker\u003c/strong\u003e\nMetaphorically ”hiding” behind the podium or showing distance from the audience, which is a natural behavior if one’s stressed.\n✔ → Know your audience and practice with your talk to achieve confidence, pay attention to your body language.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📣 \u003cstrong\u003eHecklers\u003c/strong\u003e\nThat kind of guest who monopolize your talk by continuously asking (often tricky) questions, making you lose time and patience. The agenda is at risk with heckers!\n✔ → Don’t be afraid to be the bad guy! Your scope is to protect your audience from time sinks. Don’t fell for the traps, but tell the heckler to follow up after the talk and remind him that you have a lot more to talk about. Deal decisively (eye contact, short sentences, firm tone).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎎 \u003cstrong\u003eGo Meta\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t talk about the talk, boooooring (e.g. technical issues you had before starting or anecdotes about the preparation).\n✔ → You already have limited time: focus on your Narrative Arc!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBackchannel\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt’s basically people tweeting or chatting with other people about the talk while you are speaking, which can bring distress and present a challenge. It’s not an antipattern, just a more complicate scenario because you may have to handle criticism in real time.\n✔ → Think about that when preparing the slides: can your message be condensed in a tweet? What’s the central point? Don’t be afraid to reply to questions and criticism during the event.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⚔ \u003cstrong\u003eLaser Weapons\u003c/strong\u003e\nLaser pointers can be effective for highlighting sections in dense slides, but they may be difficult to see for users in the back and are temporary: when you turn off the laser, the attention is gone.\n✔ → Better to use the Traveling Highlights and highlight directly in the slide\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🙋‍♂️ \u003cstrong\u003eNegative Ignorance\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you ask things like “Who’s not familiar with the XXX concept?” to better understand the level of the audience, it’s very likely that nobody will tell you the truth as they don’t want to feel stupid. Having incorrect feedbacks may bomb the presentation as you could act as too technical.\n✔ → Don’t ask these questions but be prepared (and, of course, Know Your Audience to avoid doubts). Keep in mind that part of the audience will know too much, part has no idea about the topic and the majority is in the middle. Prepare a 30-60 seconds summary of the advanced concept you want to introduce to keep as many people as possible engaged and informed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👾 \u003cstrong\u003eDual-Headed Monster\u003c/strong\u003e\nThis point is about the technical issues that can happen in case of an hybrid/online talk, which is not a real antipattern, just a slightly more difficult scenario. Outdated, as every presentation I make is online.\n✔ → Check the equipment, including the connection speed, and avoid Going Meta when an things break.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-others-presentations-slides\"\u003e❓ Others (presentations, slides)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"prepare-2\"\u003ePrepare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e😩 \u003cstrong\u003eRequired \u0026amp; Proposed (also Invited) Presentations\u003c/strong\u003e\nRequired → You have to speak (usually a difficult situation, yet it can become a low-risk opportunity to impress management and audience)\nProposed → You send an application for speaking at a conference, usually you are interested in the topic.\nInvited → You are so famous that conferences are asking you to speak there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔨 \u003cstrong\u003eExpansion Joints\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a clever trick to keep some slides that can be either skippable or a source for digression in case of time issues.

Psychological research shows that the average adult attention span is about 20 minutes. It is a good idea to split each Arc into that time frame, while the main Arc acts as a container for the entire talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👁 \u003cstrong\u003eUnifying Visual Theme\u003c/strong\u003e\nA visual theme provides benefits as it is easier to connect visual elements to the topics you are presenting. Be creative, don’t use the default clip art and images, but at the same time don’t bend your presentation to match a theme. It’s nice to use metaphors and include them as images in the presentations. E.g. a plan sprouting from soil is a theme picked by Neal Ford in its emerging tech talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛈ \u003cstrong\u003eLightning Talk\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a kind of presentation with fixed time limit, short in duration. It is difficult to create a meaningful story with limited material as it requires extensive preparation and there is no time for mistakes\u0026hellip; However it is a great occasion for being creative. You can cheat by using multiple slides with the same image and no transitions, which counts as 1 slide. \u003ca href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home\"\u003eIgnite conferences\u003c/a\u003e are an example of Lightning Talks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔫 \u003cstrong\u003eTakahashi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlso known as Lessig, it is a style of presentation with minimal imagery/verbiage and super fast transitions. Unlikely to be used with technical talks unless you want to insert a break in between, but very effective when delivering keynotes. You only need a lot of slides with one element each!

It is not meant to be presented, but rather consumed by a single person. Here you can include diagrams, (SHORT) bullet points, few words and work with a spatial layout. Pay attention to not transform it into a Slideument and create it knowing that you won’t likely have to present it → no animations, no big images, no Brain Breaks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🚢 \u003cstrong\u003eVacation Photos\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides with only full-screen images and very few (if no) words: extremely effective with storytelling, less in technical presentations, but keep it in mind as it is a key concept of the book. Users need to have an image in their minds, otherwise they will spend time and attention creating their own. Don’t distract them with too flashy images.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧯 \u003cstrong\u003eCharred Trail\u003c/strong\u003e\nA kind of slide specifically made to fix the issues with Slideuments and Bullet-Riddled Corpses. It’s an animated bullet point list where each point is appears one at a time and then grays out to keep the audience focused on the last element. The “printed” outcome will be like a classic bulleted slide, which is OK for documents, but while presenting you can make sure that the users won’t read all the bullets instead of listening. It requires a bit of tweaking with PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎩 \u003cstrong\u003eExuberant Title Top\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide type strictly related to the Charred Trail pattern (also in this case the printout will be Infodeck-friendly). The heading begins in the center of the slide and the hovers at the top while the body appear. Used to center the attention on the title, especially when it’s a bold assertion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📑 \u003cstrong\u003eContext Keeper\u003c/strong\u003e\nSimilar to Breadcrumbs but at a slide level: you can keep the same element (e.g. an image or a title) between slides while the rest changes to reveal the structure of the topic you are introducing. Suggestion: use the Morph animation in PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍞 \u003cstrong\u003eBreadcrumbs\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is easy to lose track of the agenda if the presentation is long. A breadcrumb is a slide that can be added while transitioning between the points of the agenda to remind the audience what’s the general plan and at what point of the presentation we are. It can be a copy of the agenda slide with the current bullet highlighted in bold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📚 \u003cstrong\u003eBookends (and Preroll and Crawling Credits)\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides at the beginning and at the end of the presentation with your name and contacts. Useless in my current case, but it can reassure the audience that they are in the correct room, introduce yourself and, when concluding, they can contain other URLs, for example for downloading the slides or asking for feedbacks.\nPreroll is an automatic carousel of slides to play before the beginning two or three slides with information so you can save time and attention resources.\nCrawling Credits is the opposite: an animation in Star-Wars style of the Coda at the end. Cool yet nothing special to me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎬 \u003cstrong\u003eIntermezzi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlternative to Breadcrumbs. While changing each logical part of the presentation, add a slide to introduce the new concept. We have it in our template, OK.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBacktracking\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide to bring the attention back to another slide you have shown in the past. This element is used in case of a little digression where you open a Talklet and want to come back to the original agenda. Suggestion: use a distinctive “back” transition to close the digression.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎦 \u003cstrong\u003eLive Demo\u003c/strong\u003e\nA special kind of presentation where you don’t need many slides, but you mostly use and present a tool. It can be the right way if you are talking about the tool and the audience is expected to mimic you and learn.\nIt is particuarly difficult to make a good Live Demo! Practice a lot, practice how to talk while using the tool to keep the audience interested, and expect to make mistakes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e✈ \u003cstrong\u003eTraveling Highlights (and Crawling Code)\u003c/strong\u003e\nFor slides with source code or huge amount of information, highlight the section you are talking about with a subtle window animation.\nCrawling Code adds boxed or highlights to the part of code mentioned, hiding all the rest to avoid distractions (e.g. \u003ca href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/encryption-boot-camp-on-the-jvm\"\u003eSlide 24 of Encryption Boot Camp on the JVM\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔔 \u003cstrong\u003eEmergence\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you want to reveal the key slide of your presentation, which requires a buildup first, slowly build hype with subtle animations to initially obscure part of the slide and then suddenly reveal the content, piece by piece.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/presentation_patterns_cover.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/01/personal-notes-about-presentation-patterns/","title":"Personal Notes about Presentation Patterns"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThere is something bizarre with me if two of my favourite activities are writing documentation and hitting my head against tests, which are notoriously unexciting activities for many developers 😫\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, we are all unique in our own way and I decided to contribute to \u003ca href=\"https://codecov.io/github/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003ethe testing module\u003c/a\u003e of one of my favorite libraries, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003enotion-sdk-py\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing \u003ca href=\"https://www.credly.com/badges/f15407b3-5fa8-4d9b-99cf-d862399a1543/public_url\"\u003ea certified Notion user\u003c/a\u003e, I use its Web App on a daily basis, and the Python library helps me automatically organize my notes.

This is a \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators\"\u003egenerator\u003c/a\u003e, a function that returns a lazy iterator which doesn’t store its content in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this method, there will be a final step for cleaning up everything and resetting the environment even in case of a failure.

E.g. \u003ccode\u003eColours = {”Red”, “White”, “Blue”}\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ccode\u003eAnimals = {(”Dog”, “Woof”),( “Cat”, “Meow”)}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"calculated-columns\"\u003eCalculated Columns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten as \u003ccode\u003e‘Table Name’[Column Name]\u003c/code\u003e, calculated columns are new columns added to the data model, and you can use them just like a default one, independently from the context. Just be aware that in Import Mode (the standard one), they are calculated during the data refresh, then stored in memory, occupying some precious RAM! If you have a complex formula, don’t break it down into intermediate steps as you do in Excel, but rather create and test it in DAX Studio and store the result in a single calculated column to optimize the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should use a calculated column if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe result will be in a slicer, matrix, pivot, or \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e condition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have an expression that is relative to the single row and doesn’t require aggregation, like \u003ccode\u003ePrice * Quantity\u003c/code\u003e which must use the Price of the row and the Quantity of the row\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have to categorize text or numbers, e.g. assigning a High, Medium, Low range, or 0-18, 18-25, 25+.

Generally, you should use them when you don’t want to calculate values for each row, but you want an aggregation: in fact, a measure has an implicit CALCULATE clause in its formula and is modified by the context (see Chapter 5). Here’s a good example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you create a calculated column like \u003ccode\u003eSales[GrossMarginPct] = Sales[GrossMargin] / Sales[SalesAmount]\u003c/code\u003e, you will see that the total is more than 100% (If our ten products have a 50% Gross Margin each, the table displays 50*10 → 500%)! DAX is applying the formula row-by-row, but we want to see the total instead.

It returns a list of unique values, requiring a table or a list of columns, not an expression; if you use \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e with more than a column, it will give back all the possible unique combinations existing in the table. \u003ccode\u003eALLEXCEPT\u003c/code\u003e can be translated as ‘take everything from that table except the following columns’. The rest will be explained in Chapter 14.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"valuesdistinctblank\"\u003eVALUES,DISTINCT,BLANK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e return a list of unique values too… With a big difference. \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e returns the visible values, so it’s not ignoring the active filters, and the same does \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e. They are different in the case of invalid relations. There’s a great example in the chapter: if, for example, a product is missing from the Product table, the join between it and the Sales table will have blank rows in the results. In this case, \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e gets confused when calculating the average amount for product, while \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e considers the blank row correctly in the division.

If you understand context, you will avoid the most common errors when you code in DAX.

A context is, in short, the environment where the expression is evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filter-context\"\u003eFilter Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not able to explain it as well as in the book without examples, but here’s my personal interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a table with a measure, say \u003ccode\u003eTotalSales = SUMX(Sales[Amount]\u003c/code\u003e. A table has rows and cells. Every expression is evaluated based on its cell, which in turn is modified based on active filters and the selected column. So, the TotalSales measure will be, say, 30Mln if I put it into a card with no filters and just a cell, but if I use it in a table with multiple rows the is split based on the row’s contents (imagine a division by Area: Europe, US, Asia → 30mln will become 10mln x 3 cells. Behind the scenes, DAX is adding a \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e saying \u003ccode\u003eFILTER (Area = ‘Europe’)\u003c/code\u003e and so on, for every cell). So, the filter context changes the outcome of the expression considering the filters that become active if, for example, it’s inside a specific cell of a table. What’s important is the context of the cell containing it: which is precisely the filter context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"row-context\"\u003eRow Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe example I recommend to read carefully uses this calculated column \u003ccode\u003eSales[Gross Margin] = Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e. Now remember, this column reasons in terms of rows, so, how does DAX manages to understand which row is working on? Using row context, which is basically a cursor. Row context, then, calculates the expression by considering the row that contains it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you write Gross Margin as a measure, you lose the row context, thus you need the iterative version ending with X: \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) )\u003c/code\u003e . The iterative version works because it uses SUMX, capable of keeping the row context. \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e is invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-notes\"\u003eOther Notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… The chapter goes on with several interesting examples and questions for understanding the contexts, especially when used in filters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of complex functions that work in two different contexts, there’s the \u003ccode\u003eEARLIER\u003c/code\u003e function for accessing the more external layer. Honestly, I hope to never use it, it’s extremely tricky, read the book to understand how the switch works, but even the authors admit that variables work better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden rule: \u003cstrong\u003erow context iterates, filter context filters\u003c/strong\u003e. Thus you can’t use the row context without a \u003ccode\u003eRELATED/RELATEDTABLE\u003c/code\u003e. On the contrary, the filter context uses relationships automatically, but be aware that its behavior can be different depending on the relationship’s direction (see chapter 15). I point out a very interesting example with \u003ccode\u003eSUMMARIZE\u003c/code\u003e in the case of the calculation of the average customers’ age without including duplicates: the code shows how to include a different column, read it carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-sql\" data-lang=\"sql\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCorrect Average :\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e AVERAGEX ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- Iterate on\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSUMMARIZE ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- all the existing combinations\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales, \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- that exist in Sales\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[CustomerKey], \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- of the customer key and\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- the customer age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t), \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e--\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- and average the customer\u0026#39;s age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e) \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- TODO: you should break it down in a variable and use AVERAGEX too\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠️ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCALCULATE\u003c/code\u003e is the most important and powerful DAX function and the one with significant nuances to understand. \u003ccode\u003eCALCULATETABLE\u003c/code\u003e is the same but returns a table.

Again, see the example, sometimes this strategy can be slow, but it\u0026rsquo;s easily scalable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReducing the use of CallbackDataID: this is very nice; you can replace \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ROUND(Sales[Net Price],0))\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(VALUES(Sales[Net Price], CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]) * ROUND(Sales[Net Price]0)\u003c/code\u003e and the engine will store part of the query in memory, speeding up future operations!

I could give it a chance, it has good reviews for beginners. A surprising book. Extremely well written, with a story about Dan Harris\u0026rsquo; evolution, who has a very stressful and competitive job, and over the years he felt increasingly stressed and disliked by people. Starting from a few philosophy books he happened to read, he got interested, at first completely skeptical, but he kept going. He ended up in Buddhism, started meditating, even just 5 minutes a day, and it changed his life. Fantastic story, very realistic because he also calls the spiritual elements a bunch of nonsense, and he\u0026rsquo;s super practical! And on top of that it\u0026rsquo;s seasoned with his life as a journalist, full of insights and adventures. Like with the book by the consultant of How to Make Things Faster, the mix of personal stories and practical concepts works!

[\u0026hellip;] Communion with a single body here and now makes you feel connected with the entire cosmos. In truth, your beloved is just another human being, no different from all those you ignore every day on the train or at the supermarket. Yet to you, he or she seems infinite, and you are happy to lose yourself in that infinity.

The author distanced himself from it a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a stark book about how manipulation works. Like Cialdini\u0026rsquo;s and maybe Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, it draws fierce criticism, and people often blame the messenger.

And this is a sharp knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the book is off-putting. It reads as if it assumes that everyone around us is plotting, so you must strike from behind, lie, and generally be unpleasant to get ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you realize it is sadly like this in many environments. This is not a rulebook to follow (absolutely not), but more a collection of warrior and strategist behaviors we should know, so we do not get taken advantage of. So there is something sensible buried in this hefty book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read it quickly because it is long, and Greene adds four, five, six anecdotes for each rule, almost always with some Roman/Chinese/French general and some trick.

Typically, people are working extremely\nhard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your\nusers are vocally dissatisfied.\nA team is treading water if they\u0026rsquo;re able to get their critical work\ndone, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or\nbegin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are\nstill working hard, and your users may seem happier because\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve learned that asking for help won\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere.\nA team is repaying debt when they\u0026rsquo;re able to start paying down\ntechnical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt\nrepayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more\ntime to repay more debt.\n2.2.2\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably\nlow, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user\nneeds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer.

Go somewhere that\u0026rsquo;s\ndisproportionately valuable to you because of who you are and\nwhat you want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the one thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found at companies with very few\ninterruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really\ngreat, consistently available documentation. It\u0026rsquo;s probably even\nharder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting\ncompany than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing\ncompany, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I\u0026rsquo;ve seen\nis a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a\ndocumentation search that actually works.\nThere are a non-zero number of companies that do internal\ndocumentation well, but I\u0026rsquo;m less sure if there are a non-zero\nnumber of companies with more than 20 engineers that do this\nwell. If you know any, please let me know so that I can pick their\nbrains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour first reaction might be to confront this head-on, but it takes\na while to build credibility after starting a new job. Sure, you\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen hired for your experience, so they respect your judgment,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s a hard sell to convince someone that your personal\nexperience should invalidate their personal experience.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying something different.\nModel. Start measuring your team\u0026rsquo;s health (maybe using short,\nmonthly surveys) and your team\u0026rsquo;s throughput (do some\nlightweight form of task sizing, even if you just do it informally\nwith a senior engineer on the team or with yourself), which will\nallow you to establish the baseline before your change.\nThen just start running kanban. Don\u0026rsquo;t publicize it, don\u0026rsquo;t make a\nbig deal about it, just start doing it with your team. Frame it as a\nshort experiment with the team, and start trying it. Keep iterating\non it until you\u0026rsquo;re confident it works. Have the courage to keep at it\nfor a while, and also the courage to stop doing it if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\nafter a month or two. Use the team\u0026rsquo;s health and throughput\nmetrics to ground your decision about whether it\u0026rsquo;s working.\nDocument. After you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered an effective approach,\ndocument the problem you set out to solve, the learning process\nyou went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. Be as detailed as possible:\nmake a canonical document, and even get a few folks on other\nteams to check that it\u0026rsquo;s readable from their perspective.\nShare. The final step is to share your documented approach,\nalong with your experience doing the rollout, in a short email.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t ask everyone to adopt the practice, don\u0026rsquo;t lobby for change,\njust present the approach and your experience following it.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that\nwork effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting\nhow you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to\nchange their approach.\nStrangely, in my experience, this has often led to more adoption\nthan top-down mandates have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few years to glean a lesson from that experience, but\nit comes to mind frequently now when I work with folks who are\njust starting to present to executives. Giving a presentation to\nsenior leadership is a bit of a dark art: it takes a while to master,\nand most people who do it well can\u0026rsquo;t quite articulate how they do\nit. Worse yet, many people who are excellent rely on advantages\nthat resist replication: charisma, quick wit, deep subject matter\nexpertise, or years of experience. Start with the conclusion. Particularly in written\ncommunication, folks skim until they get bored and then stop\nreading. Accommodate this behavior by starting with what\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant, instead of building toward it gradually.\nFrame why the topic matters. Typically, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting on\nan area that you\u0026rsquo;re intimately familiar with, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably very\nobvious to you why the work matters. This will be much less\nobvious to folks who don\u0026rsquo;t think about the area as often. Start by\nexplaining why your work matters to the company.\nEveryone loves a narrative. Another aspect of framing the topic\nis providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and\nwhere you\u0026rsquo;re going now. This should be a sentence or two along\nthe lines of, \u0026ldquo;Last year, we had trouble closing several important\ncustomers due to concerns about our scalability. We identified\nour databases as our constraints to scaling, and since then our\nfocus has been moving to a new sharding model that enables\nhorizontal scaling. That\u0026rsquo;s going well, and we expect to finish in Answer directly. Senior leaders tend to be indirectly responsible\nfor wide areas, and frequently pierce into areas to debug\nproblems. Their experience \u0026ldquo;debug piercing\u0026rdquo; tunes their radar for\nevasive answers, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a blip on that screen.\nInstead of hiding problems, use them as an opportunity to explain\nyour plans to address them.\nDeep in the data. You should be deep enough in your data that\nyou can use it to answer unexpected questions. This means\nspending time exploring the data, and the most common way to\ndo that is to run a thorough goal-setting exercise.\nDerive actions from principles. One of your aims is to provide a\nmental model of how you view the topic, allowing folks to get\nfamiliar with how you make decisions. Showing you are \u0026ldquo;in the\ndata\u0026rdquo; is part of this. The other aspect is defining the guiding\nprinciples you\u0026rsquo;re using to approach decisions.\nDiscuss the details. Some executives test presenters by diving\ninto the details, trying to uncover an area the presenter is\nuncomfortable speaking on. You should be familiar with the\ndetails, e.g., project statuses, but I think that it\u0026rsquo;s usually best to\nreframe the discussion when you get too far into the details. Try\nto pop up to either the data or the principles, which tend to be\nmore useful conversations.\nPrepare a lot; practice a little. If you\u0026rsquo;re presenting to your entire\ncompany, practicing your presentation is time well spent.\nLeadership presentations tend to quickly detour, so practice isn\u0026rsquo;t\n38\nquite as useful. Practice until you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable, but prefer to\nprepare instead getting deeper into the data, details, and\nprinciples. As a corollary, if you\u0026rsquo;re knowledgeable in the area\nyou\u0026rsquo;re responsible for, and have spent time getting comfortable\nwith the format, over time you\u0026rsquo;ll find that you won\u0026rsquo;t need to\nprepare much for these specifically. Rather, whether you\u0026rsquo;re able\nto present effectively without much preparation will become a\nsignal for whether you\u0026rsquo;re keeping up with your span of\nresponsibility.\nMake a clear ask. If you don\u0026rsquo;t go into a meeting with leadership\nwith a clear goal, your meeting will either go nowhere or go\npoorly. Start the meeting by explicitly framing your goal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis refined list of goals, aligned to your company\u0026rsquo;s priorities,\nthen becomes a central artifact for how you and your manager\ncollaborate on your career evolution. Every quarter or so, take\nsome time to refresh the document and review it together.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unconvinced that it\u0026rsquo;s worth your time to write a career\nnarrative, you certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have to write one. Most folks get\naway with not writing one for their entire career and have deeply\nfulfilling careers despite the absence.\nThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-\ncovering the same patch. Don\u0026rsquo;t go there.

A very difficult and long book, but decidedly illuminating. Taleb is sharply polemical and candid, offering a unique perspective on modern economics and the fragility of systems.

The absence of stress and competition, as well as an overabundance of choices, harms us.

I have to say the read was engaging, a 4-star for the author\u0026rsquo;s humor (same vibe as Uncanny Valley) as he pokes fun, with solid satire, at the UN\u0026rsquo;s machinery, which at the time was operating in Iraq for the Food-for-Oil program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, the story is that Saddam\u0026rsquo;s regime sold oil to a roster of companies and trusted figures, who took a cut to resell it at a higher price worldwide, giving a portion back (kickback) to Iraq.

A couple of final chapters were too tough, but otherwise I came away amazed and fascinated by this complicated world I did not know. One of the most beautiful and useful books I have ever read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecode means a system for transferring information among people and machines, aka to communicate. The Italian vocabulary is itself a code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction with Morse code used to communicate between two houses by the child protagonists who only have flashlights, already impressive. Key idea is two: dots and dashes, binary. Introduction to powers of two to explain the number of possible combinations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to Braille, which has a fascinating history and an ingenious structure that saves a lot of space with abbreviations and prefixes that alter the following words (shift codes). With two to the sixth combinations, a reminder of binary concepts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to electricity and how a flashlight works\u0026hellip; the battery has many atoms exchanging electrons, closing the circuit with a chemical reaction between the two ends. I = E/R, with current as how much electricity is flowing (Ampere), Resistance (Ohm) is how much the material blocks it, and E is voltage, how much potential energy there is. A disconnected battery always has the same voltage, but very high resistance since air does not conduct. Useful. Wattage for light bulbs is E x I\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSurprising: you can use grounding to conduct electricity using the Earth itself. Plant a large copper rod (symbolizes the beginning of the circuit, aka V). This way you do not need a second wire because the ground closes the circuit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of the telegraph, which opened and closed circuits making a click-clack sound to be translated into Morse code. Connections were copper wire between the first utility poles. Explanation of repeaters, which connected the click-clack sounder to the input and repeated the same thing instead of requiring human effort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of number systems, which are themselves a code. For me the number 3 stands for three because I assign that meaning to it. Zero was a tremendous invention. A digression on non-decimal systems by pretending to be a cartoon character with 8 fingers (brilliant, you understand how a base-8 system thinks by excluding 8 and 9). Excellent introduction to the bit, which is the binary digit (reasoning with a code of only 0 and 1, explained well by simulating being a dolphin with only two fingers/fins)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHistory of binary code, the simplest possible system for counting. Any information can be broken down and expressed in bits. For example a barcode is a sequence of spaces and lines symbolizing 0 and 1 in succession, and since there are many they allow 2 to the x combinations of codes. They have a lot of checks to prevent a barcode from being tampered with or misprinted (but in the end the same numbers are printed in clear text under the code). Shows both Morse and Braille converted into binary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of Boole and boolean logic. It connects to logic gates, which use current in series and in parallel to simulate + and x statements as if they were switches. Good parallel on how they physically correspond to current on and off and I learned AND, NAND, OR, and NOR\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBinary machine: build an adder from the components of the previous chapter. Introduced the XOR gate, which gives 1 if only one of A or B is 1, combining OR and NAND. Use an XOR and an AND to add bits with a carry if both are 1 (10). It ends up looking like this. PCs still use a system like this at the base, but obviously with microscopic, fast transistors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSubtraction is like addition but uses borrow instead of carry. If both bits are one you take the borrow from the column to the left and not the right. Overview of the machine with this feature, similar structure. To avoid the hassle of borrow it uses a trick with 9s called nine\u0026rsquo;s complement. Mathematical detail I can skip here. Introduction to overflow, which warns you if the number is larger than the bits available. To combine add and subtract it has another gate that defines the operation. If subtract, it simply inverts B with the ones\u0026rsquo; complement (like 9s but in binary). For example 9 - 4 will be 9 + (-4). Another trick for signs: instead of using a separate bit for the minus, split the available bits. For example from 0 to 499 the positives, and from 500 to 999 the negatives. This causes errors so that if you run out of bits then from 499 + 1 you go to -499. Now I get it. The leftmost bit will be 0 for positives and 1 for negatives. A number with this property is signed vs unsigned, and subtraction works in this somewhat convoluted way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeedback: introduces an oscillator, a relay with input = output that alternates quickly between 0 and 1. It can also be called a clock because it oscillates at regular, measurable intervals, aka cycles per second aka Hertz. It also covers flip-flops, which are a cross-coupled feedback of two NORs to remember the system state. A complex trick to create a latch, which allows setting and resetting a variable to a number, which can then be connected to the previous machine. They are also very useful for counting on each oscillation. I got lost here, I admit it, but I understand why they count so quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to hexadecimal code, the one used in colors, which for numbers beyond 9 uses A, B, \u0026hellip; F. Brilliant. It is used because 8 bits are a byte, and for big numbers two bytes are enough, so base sixteen is convenient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscusses memory, in particular RAM which stores some bytes to read and write information quickly not in sequence (as if it were a locker). ROM instead is sequential, and uses a control panel to access the appropriate addresses\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutomation: very dense chapter about opcodes and assembly, and how we can use two RAMs to store information (example of addition and multiplication). Here it goes into memory addresses, in this case 2 bytes, and there is a third byte for the instruction, which can be Load, Add, Subtract, Carry with Zero, Halt, and other precise situations. Quite heavy because it is more complicated than that, but in practice it works like this, and we have just seen the split between Data and Code. One RAM stores data in memory and accepts instructions in the form of other encoded bytes. To reread\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecap of the history of computers, from the first abaci to Babbage to the founder of IBM who used punch cards to Turing and Von Neumann, of which we built a replica earlier. They first use vacuum tubes and telephone relays, but transistors revolutionize everything by being semiconductors. They use metals like silicon between two doped layers of semiconductors that reduce heat and size. Chips exploit this layering even more to pack many connectors into a small space. Moore created this law about power roughly doubling every few years. In the end a computer moves a byte from one place to another, back and forth. Speed is essential for power, which is why there has been a race to put as many bits as possible on each microprocessor and to improve materials. Very complex chapter on how they handle information at that level and on how x86, x64, and company do not play well together\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eASCII and characters. Computers have everything in bits so how we want to display them depends on the chosen format, meaning how we choose to translate bits into text. Baudot assigns two hex bits for 30 letters, with a special one to switch to numbers if needed (like CAPS). ASCII standardizes hex into characters and is essential for computers to understand each other. It has a very interesting feature where you can subtract 20h to go from uppercase to lowercase. It was created with punch cards where you chose the hex and wrote things for the computer. Since they had not accounted for Asian writing systems and special symbols, Unicode was introduced with 16 bits and 65k characters. A bit larger but much less ambiguous\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePart about the bus I will skip because I did not understand it. RAM and ROM\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOperating System. This is indeed a challenge because when you turn off the PC, RAM loses everything it had in memory. An OS has a sequence of commands to reestablish the situation and is used to set commands for the computer in memory. Line by line the data is saved in memory thanks to OS instructions. Included there is a file system, which contains all the paths of objects, which are essentially memory addresses. Introduction to CP/M, a very basic system, and the subsequent rise of Linux, UNIX, GNU. Interesting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to fractional and irrational numbers, which we still need to represent in bits. Idea of fixed-point format where there is a certain bit with the decimal fixed, for example two decimal places. There is also floating-point notation where you express the number in a particular decimal notation. Very efficient, but it becomes less precise with large numbers so for banks and the like you keep fixed point, while for something like YouTube views floating is fine. To do operations with this complexity of floating points Intel had to make a dedicated chip in the 80s\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMicroprocessors do not understand assembly language so you need to translate it into bytes, that is, compile it, turning it into an executable. Compilers are even tougher because they synthesize commands in high-level languages into a few bytes and this requires structure. Low-level languages can communicate more directly with the machine and this can lead to interesting performance tricks like bit shifting accumulation. Uses ALGOL as a reference for a high-level language, which feels familiar. The low-level part had me lost in the instructions, it is now less useful in general cases. Example program in ALGOL, very familiar structure, and a brief history of the evolution of programs, from COBOL to FORTRAN to C, Lisp and company\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGraphics section.

First, park in a safe spot where you can take your time. For a small puncture you can temporarily use foam sealant. If you need to change it you need a jack and a four-way lug wrench. Read the manual, lift the car at the designated point with the jack and loosen the lug nuts. You may need force and a bit of oil. Bring a rag just in case. I saw how to do it in Switzerland: remember to put out the triangle and wear the vest, then work calmly, remove the hubcap if it\u0026rsquo;s clipped in, possibly the wheel cover, then place the jack where indicated (about 16 cm from the tire), loosen the nuts a bit, lift until you have a finger of clearance, remove the nuts without losing them, swap the wheel, tighten in a criss-cross pattern to balance the load, lower the car and give the nuts a final tighten, then drive off without rushing. Lesson learned.\nAnother tip: if the jack fails and the car drops, you might not be able to lift it again. Place wood or something sturdy as a safety support, and if the ground is unstable chock the other wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Oil leaks: if you see a spot under the car, identify the source. Engine oil is black, washer fluid is blue, transmission fluid is dark red/brown, and coolant varies. If it\u0026rsquo;s very oily, it\u0026rsquo;s likely a lubricant. You can try to trace the source and see if a gasket is leaking and can be fixed, but you will likely need a mechanic to replace it. Not an emergency but deal with it soon. Be careful tightening fittings so you don\u0026rsquo;t damage them, do it gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Oil warning light in general: if it\u0026rsquo;s yellow the level is probably low or the pressure is off. Pull over, wait 15 minutes, then use the dipstick to check the level. If it\u0026rsquo;s low, buy some oil at the nearest station and top up at the oil filler cap. Not urgent, but low oil can damage the engine over time, and if it runs out the engine can fail. If the level looks fine or the light behaves oddly (red or flashing), that\u0026rsquo;s a concern.

Wait a bit, then start yours and let it recharge while still connected, then take a short drive to confirm all is okay. When working on a battery always remove the negative cable first and reconnect it last. Check for corrosion now and then, and remove it with a small brush if needed. Batteries often have a hydrometer eye indicator that shows, by color, if it\u0026rsquo;s charged, discharged, or needs service.\nStill on the battery, test before replacing: charge it and see if it holds. If it cannot hold a charge, it is done.

This nice video shows how to change it. Not a big concern, aside from the first time when all the fluid drains out, which can be surprising. Depends on the car. It only costs 10-30 euros at a mechanic, so I would let them do it. Check the car\u0026rsquo;s instructions to know which coolant you need. I tend to confuse it, probably an antifreeze/coolant mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throttle body (3️⃣) is a key engine component and can be cleaned easily.

You can also open the hood and see if there is debris in the air intake (filters 2️⃣). The book then describes a more involved disinfecting with specific products, worth reading up on.

For others there are kits to repair as soon as possible before it becomes a crack. It must be completely dry, and you apply the kit carefully to the glass, which looks like a small patch or an injector of adhesive, depending on the kit. See if it works. If the crack spreads, the glass is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStoring your car for a long time. Read the Storing Your Car chapter.

Remove as much water as possible before mold grows, there will be water everywhere. If it reaches the ECU there may be irreparable damage, check the high-water mark carefully. Check the oil filter; if it has water droplets you may need an oil change. If water got inside, air out and clean mats and interior, and rinse external components that may have gotten dirty like the brakes. The onboard computer should be removed and cleaned with great care since it is not waterproof. Also check the lights. In theory they are fine, but water can get in and you need to dry the housing. In general electrical components are protected. Test thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepair paint chips (💥). Since a body shop can be expensive, you can try to fix it by buying primer and clearcoat, because the paint is layered. Mask the area to fill, sand it (the book lists grits) and apply the suggested products. Again, check the chapter images. If you are not satisfied, you can try spray paint (still masking the area) and then lightly sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Removing stickers (maybe the vignette).

Wear eye protection because of flying debris, and you cut the pipe. I will not do this, so if it happens I will read that chapter. Most issues are rust.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Suspension (3️⃣ restore if used hard): you notice because the car takes hits poorly, like a truck. I think the book focuses on SUVs/vans in this chapter. You unscrew and inspect various components, especially shocks. They should be replaced about every 60k miles, depending on use, but replacement is complex. I saw a video and I would not do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange oil and filter (the car alerts you): there is a video on how, but you need a way to raise the car. I will have a mechanic do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange the water pump (1️⃣0️⃣): watch if coolant temperature climbs a lot; around 100k km it should be replaced. Be alert if there are leaks, which is rare, since it can seriously damage the engine. If you smell coolant, pay attention. With recent tech it should be reliable anyway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The starter solenoid (or starter motor) is the device that engages the engine with the battery when you turn the key. If it fails you hear click-click-click as it spins without engaging (happened before). Could also be a battery issue. On the Dacia I will not touch it, it is just useful to know this component exists, like a small switch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Ignition timing matters. The timing belt is a gear system you might adjust if the engine struggles to accelerate. There is a close-up of what I mean. They mark the current position on the pulley and turn it a certain way. I doubt I will ever do this. If needed, reread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The engine mount (5️⃣ they start to crack) protects the engine from shocks and vibrations. If it has issues you notice jerks and engine vibrations. Replace if needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The cooling fan is one or two large fans that run the AC and help cool the engine. If it fails you will get hot air and risk overheating. They show how to check the connectors with a battery, and you can test the fan directly. I doubt I can do much beyond that. Replacing it is involved; you have to remove a lot around the engine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe transmission filter (and fluid) (3️⃣). There is a video that gives the idea. It reminds me of the oil filter and I may be mixing them up. I would have a mechanic do it since it takes some skill (unscrew, clean, scrape), though it is not the most complex job. It matters because it manages the driven wheels. Do they do this during service? If it is not right, steering or response may feel off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHitching a trailer, if I ever need it.

Example: an online courses company that kept adding new items to hit targets, but everything was rushed and poorly done, and users did not use it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. Focus on end results, not on what you produced\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA product has no inherent value. What matters is what it does for the customer, e.g., solving a problem\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you do not measure the impact of your work on the customer, you will never know which outcomes you are delivering\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSales-led organizations do not work. Sales does not know what to bring, so they overpromise, and IT struggles. The process should start with the product manager, who listens to the customer, focuses on a problem, tests a feature on a small scale, and provides Sales with a roadmap they can take forward\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo product-led companies set a general strategy, then follow with features to achieve that goal (e.g., increase the number of courses per instructor), prioritizing projects with the highest impact\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConcept of known knowns and unknown unknowns. Plan with what you know and what you expect not to know.

You need a strategy and core values to follow, making hard choices without straying from them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is not a plan. It is a decision-making framework\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExamples of good frameworks: DIBBs (Spotify) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Data, Insights, Beliefs, and Bets. OKRs (Google, others) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Objectives \u0026amp; Key Results. BPM (Twilio, via First Round) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Big Picture, Priorities, Measures\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVision: more of a general direction that guides philosophical choices over the long term. Always keep it in mind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo clarify the differences. Netflix example: Strategic intent = lead the streaming market.  Product initiative = enable people to watch Netflix on any device, wherever viewers wanted to. Options = Roku, Xbox app, partnerships with internet-enabled TVs, iPad App, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemember to say no to less important things to make time for innovation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"part-iv-product-management-process\"\u003ePART IV: PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PROCESS\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduces Toyota Kata, an example of a system for creating products from a problem-solving mindset\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMetrics are critical.

Quarterly Business Reviews, Product Initiative Reviews, Release Reviews\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBudgeting is important.

Then let it sit and come back to it, cutting and polishing where needed. Having an external checker can further improve the final result. Quality content = Utility x Inspiration x Empathy,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWriting well requires writing (and reading) a lot.

Why should they care?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA reading is a pact with the reader. You have to write for them. What makes them turn the pages? Certainly not to do you a favor.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSources are essential. Always verify them and credit the people you take data from.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBack to TUFD, since it is the core of the book. Do not overthink it, get everything down, write badly, write something, you will refine it later. Just. Write.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌲 After the first draft, you need to clean up the TUFD. The first check, broadly, is \u0026ldquo;editing by a chainsaw.\u0026rdquo; Cut the big parts that do not fit or do not explain your idea clearly. Your idea should be presented right away at the start, without preambles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen look at the paragraphs: does each one have an idea that was not in the one before or after? Then keep it. Otherwise, cut. \u0026ldquo;Think of sentences in a paragraph as a conversation between an elderly, companionable couple. They don\u0026rsquo;t talk over each other; they expand or elucidate what the other said before them.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔪 Then check line by line, the \u0026ldquo;surgical\u0026rdquo; approach. Trim the fat, remove adverbs, use active forms, remove phrases like \u0026ldquo;In regards to,\u0026rdquo; check the flow and make it musical. There are many specific details on this. Lines should also be interconnected.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther minor details, especially for marketing.

The message is basic; it did not leave me much, though it was explained simply.

We have no hope, or rather we have lost it, and the only way out is to stop caring about certain things.

A familiar concept from other books, seen here in how many choices are driven by one or the other, and both extremes are harmful. You need to negotiate with your Emotional brain or it will keep pushing you into impulsive choices.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo get out of the irrational problems you have (apathy, inability to get what you want, laziness), you need to suggest solutions to your Emotional brain. It is not enough to understand what is wrong; you need to find a way out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBy the way: there is no change without suffering. The lie of eternal happiness and satisfaction is sold by marketers, but the more we get, the more dissatisfied we become. Instead of always chasing joy, we should embrace suffering and understand that life is also like this. This echoes the first book: focus on immaterial experiences; those are the ones that bring real joy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe world runs on feelings: everything we do aims either to upgrade pain (e.g., pain from braces instead of pain from crooked teeth) or to hide it (watching Netflix instead of the pain of studying, temporarily numbing it like a painkiller). Unfortunately, instead of upgrading or improving it, most new companies focus on hiding it, not solving the problem.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLove people without expecting anything in return. This is the book\u0026rsquo;s takeaway for me, and I want to follow it through: love others naturally, create hope in others, be the first to start. A bit vague and again borrowed from the first book, to be honest.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not shoot for the best, be the best.

It works, but the protagonists\u0026rsquo; tone bored me because they explained too much, and some of the military parts felt awkward.

We usually leverage several storage solutions, since each kind of DB works best in a specific environment. Questions to ask when choosing: is it compatible with our speed rates, could it be a bottleneck, do we understand how the tech works, will it anticipate future scale, will the vendor guarantee the SLA, do we capture metadata, is it pure (object storage) or does it support query patterns (cloud DWH), is it schemaless/hybrid/enforced, how are we tracking records and schemas and governance. Also remember the difference between hot and cold data (for compliance but not accessed)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIngestion: this is usually the bottleneck of the data architecture, while source systems, the biggest culprit, are not under our control or responsibility. Focus on making a reliable system by asking these questions: the use cases, what systems generate the data and when they are available, what the data destination is, how frequently we need to access the data and in which volume, what their format is, whether it is in good shape or we need to modify it. Plus differences between batch and streaming ingestion; usually batch is more efficient and simpler (and far more used unless you have a critical need for live data)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTransformation: the stage where you transform the data before the next parts of the process. This is mostly related to changing types, removing errors, schema changes, and normalization. Consider costs and keep transformations as simple as possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eServing: you can use the data in different ways. Analytics, ML, and reverse ETL are the most popular. With analytics we talk about BI (which often requires further cleaning, and ideally a self-service approach), or operational/embedded analytics (for example, inventory live or customer dashboards). ML is straightforward here. Reverse ETL is the process of putting data back into source systems, long considered an antipattern, but often a necessity (for example, marketing using sales data and uploading forecasts back into the system)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecurity: the principle of least privilege is crucial, and also giving access only for the duration necessary to perform the work\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefinition:\nEnterprise architecture is the design of systems to support change in the enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through careful evaluation of trade-offs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePillars of a good data architecture:\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChoose common components wisely.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlan for failure.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArchitect for scalability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArchitecture is leadership.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways be architecting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuild loosely coupled systems. → See Bezos API Mandate where every team must communicate by API only\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake reversible decisions → Bezos two-way door\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrioritize security → Zero trust security etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmbrace FinOps → DevOps with Finance involved\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrownfield (replace legacy systems) vs Greenfield: in both cases be cautious and assess a strategy that slowly brings in the new feature, cleaning up progressively\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eData Mart (DWH for analytics, further step) vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso mentions the data lakehouse as a likely future direction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTalking about the modern stack: key concepts are self-service, agile data management, and clear pricing/open source\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: the Lambda (batch and stream to be joined together) and Kappa (one giant stream, expensive at scale) architectures were introduced for managing large real-time streaming data.

In recent decades we have reduced the share of people suffering from hunger from 65% in the 1950s to 10% today by increasing production and efficiency with machines and fertilizers that require a lot of fuel. Wheat production, for example, went from 10 minutes per kilogram of flour in the 1800s to 2 seconds today with machines that do everything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNitrogen is fundamental for accelerating crop production and we have plenty of it, but paradoxically it is hard to obtain in nature (since it is N2 in the atmosphere). You can use animal fertilizer, or grow soybeans and other tubers that have an enzyme that splits nitrogen, fertilizing the soil for later crops. But synthesized ammonia developed in the 1900s solved this problem in a revolutionary way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst pillar, ammonia (it should be ammoniaca in Italian).

Created in the early 1900s with a process that heats hydrocarbons, it is part of essentially everything we use every day and is irreplaceable, even though it is polluting and energy-hungry. Literally everything we use generally has some plastic component.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThird pillar, steel.

It was natural selection. Under given environmental conditions only the most suited survive; the others die. Those who survive have offspring and pass their traits to their children. Generation after generation, the most suitable traits are selected. But note: Darwin reached these conclusions many years after his return.

Bressanini explains very clearly (as he does on YouTube) and does not hesitate to use big chemistry terms that many readers might skip, but they still lend professionalism to the result. I focused on the practical information, without diving into all the technicalities, and here is a general home guide I built from the key points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlthough we tend to be wary of chemical products at the supermarket and prefer grandma\u0026rsquo;s compounds (like vinegar, lemon, etc.), chemists have refined these formulas for decades and they will usually do a better job than DIY mixes. There are strict European regulations on this; they are safe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever mix substances together. You risk generating toxic gases. At best, combinations like an acid and a base (vinegar + baking soda) cancel each other out, so the result is worse.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTake time to read ingredient lists. People fear long chemical names like triphosphate or sodium hydroxide, but every compound has a technical name and a lot is marketing. Do not be misled.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt all depends on pH: acidic soils are removed with alkaline products, and vice versa.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarketing plays a big role. Many products do roughly the same thing since the core chemistry is similar. That does not mean you should always buy the cheapest option, but you do not need to overspend either. Results are often similar. Try a product and stick with what works best for you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-limescale\"\u003e1. Limescale\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLimescale is calcium carbonate that forms from heated water. Calcium precipitates and sticks to surfaces like shower walls, toilets, and faucets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ It is not harmful to humans. In fact, our bodies use calcium. Drinking hard water can contribute calcium to the diet.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVinegar dissolves calcium carbonate, so it is a valid traditional solution, but it smells and is not acidic enough to be very effective. Purpose-made descalers work better. Bressanini examines Viakal (not as a specific recommendation, but as an example of a solid product) and its composition: water, citric acid to dissolve limescale, surfactants to increase solubility in water, citrate and sodium hydroxide to regulate pH, fragrances and colorants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese products are good for cleaning sanitary ware and damaged ceramics. There are specific notes for special cases (for example, scratches in a bathtub might be permanent). One tip: use low-mineral bottled water in coffee machines because limescale can damage them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2-soaps\"\u003e2. Soaps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarseille soap is not necessarily made in Marseille and is not a registered trademark. The term usually refers to a hard soap. So-called neutral soap is also a marketing term; soap must be alkaline (pH 9+) to remove dirt. It simply means it has no free caustic soda.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSkipping the history here. Today there are two main soap bases: coconut or palm kernel oils that bring lauric acid and produce more foam, and palm oil or tallow that foam less and harden the bar. Commercial blends are often around 70% palm and 30% coconut, but it varies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost soaps are broadly similar in composition. Marketing adds small amounts of scented oils, but they are a tiny fraction.

Detergents and laundry detergents\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese are ideal for removing almost any type of soil from fabrics, but they can struggle with greasy residues (often from skin or food).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA key component is surfactants: special molecules that are half hydrophobic and half hydrophilic. They trap soil and bind to water, carrying the dirt away.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA good detergent has surfactants (higher-end products may have up to 50%, which are costly), polymers to disperse dirt in water, enzymes to break down soil, a small percentage of fragrances, and optical brighteners. Fun fact: a brightener does not make laundry whiter by removing dirt. It lays a fluorescent layer that makes fabrics appear brighter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ At the supermarket you can choose powder or liquid detergents (plus capsules and pods). In general they are all decent. Powders are slightly more effective and economical, but their performance drops if you wash below 60 C. Since in Europe we often wash at 30 to 40 C, liquids work better at those temperatures. Pods are convenient and often contain compartmentalized blends that combine during the wash to boost performance, so they can be more effective. Downside: you cannot adjust the dose as freely, so there is less flexibility.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor wool and silk, read the label carefully.

For stubborn stains we use strong oxidizers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFun fact: bleach does not simply destroy soil. It removes the molecules that cause color and helps detergents by breaking down proteins and carbohydrates. Hypochlorite solutions are also very alkaline (pH 13+).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The term \u0026ldquo;bleach\u0026rdquo; is ambiguous. In Europe, bleach usually means sodium hypochlorite, a strong oxidizer that can remove color from dyed fabrics. Use on whites. \u0026ldquo;Delicate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;color-safe\u0026rdquo; bleach is a completely different oxygen-based compound.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Household bleach is usually diluted (3 to 5% hypochlorite). Higher concentration usually means more aggressive action. In Europe, use it in the dedicated compartment, cold, before the wash, and you do not need large amounts or high temperatures. For tough stains you can pre-treat briefly in a basin before washing (always wash afterward). Check the label.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLabel symbols: an empty triangle means you can bleach, a crossed-out triangle means you cannot. A triangle with two diagonal lines means you can use non-chlorine (oxygen-based) bleach only.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not let it degrade. Heat, time, and light reduce its effectiveness.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Never mix bleach with other substances. It can create toxic gases. Handle with care. Do not use it on food. It corrodes metals and is useless against limescale.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"5-percarbonate-and-oxygen\"\u003e5. Percarbonate and oxygen\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHere we are talking about oxygen-based bleaches, marketed as \u0026ldquo;delicate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;color-safe\u0026rdquo; bleach, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Hydrogen peroxide is mainly used as a disinfectant for minor wounds, and the book does not focus on it. In a pinch you can dilute it in water to treat a stain, but at low temperatures it needs a long time (overnight).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Color-safe bleach typically contains 3 to 5% hydrogen peroxide and can be used to pre-treat a colored garment with tough stains before washing, or added in the washing machine bleach compartment. It is more effective at 60 C and above.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not mix it randomly with other chemicals. You can generate unwanted reactions, splashes, or gases.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBressanini analyzes Omino Bianco color-safe bleach: it contains water (solvent), hydrogen peroxide to bleach, surfactants to reach stains, etidronic acid to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, fragrances like linalool and citronellol, sodium sulfate to stabilize electrolytes, dimethicone as an antifoam, and colorants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Hydrogen peroxide is very effective for removing blood from handkerchiefs and walls.

A washtub with an X or a crossed-out circle (meaning even professional dry cleaning is not allowed) means do not wash. You can test stain removal on a small hidden area first. A hand in a basin means hand wash only.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe machine washing symbol is a washtub with a number of degrees. One or two lines underneath indicate delicate cycles and you should reduce or skip spinning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The best wash is not washing. Since washing uses resources, you do not need to wash a garment every time you wear it, especially if it was not in contact with skin. If there are no visible stains or odors, air it and use it again. Skipping a wash is good for the environment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Many stains should be pre-treated because they are hard to remove. Main categories:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWater-soluble (sugar, toothpaste, salt) → rinse or wash\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParticulate (charcoal, ash, burnt residues, soil, rust) → bleach and detergent are not helpful; use soap and scrub\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrease (oil, butter, sauce, makeup, sebum, body oils, lubricant) → best option is surfactants in detergents, specific stain removers, or in a pinch shampoo, which shares some ingredients. Let it work, then rinse thoroughly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBleachable (many types: chlorophyll, fruit/vegetable stains, tea, coffee, henna, mustard, curry) → detergents may suffice, but a bleach can finish the job\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnzyme-treatable (various: blood, grass, body fluids, eggs, milk) → use proteases at room temperature, since heat sets proteins. They should be in detergents; check the label. Otherwise use bleach.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor yellowed linens (oxidation of sebum or cellulose) try a bleaching treatment once. If the fibers are degraded, there is nothing to do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Do not underestimate fabric softeners. They are designed to keep fibers soft and reduce friction. There is a lot of marketing since the core formula is similar (cationic surfactants that protect the fabric from limescale). Scents vary, so pick what you like. Do not use too much or it can coat the fabric and leave it greasy. It can irritate skin and, if overused, may reduce durability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"7-dishes-pots-and-glasses\"\u003e7. Dishes, pots, and glasses\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The dishwasher is by far the most effective way to wash dishes. About 90% of the cleaning power is the mechanical action of water (the rest is heat and a small contribution from detergent). Bressanini debunks the idea that handwashing is more ecological or effective: dishwashers clean roughly 3 to 4 times better and use little (around 10 L and a few tens of watts in ECO mode). Handwashing can use 35 to 470 L and can account for about 50% of household water use. It is a clear win.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandwashing is fine if you have no alternative. It is better to soak items in a basin with water and detergent, then rinse, to avoid wasting water.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Pre-rinsing dishes before the dishwasher is largely unnecessary. Modern machines are powerful. Unless it is a heavily encrusted pot (they are less effective there), you do not need to pre-rinse. If needed, run a second cycle or clean it afterward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Use dishwasher-specific detergents. They foam less, include enzymes, small amounts of surfactants (to prevent redeposition since cleaning is mechanical), bleaches, anti-limescale agents, and silicates to protect glass.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can choose powders, liquids, tablets, or pods. They are interchangeable. Liquids, gels, and pods can be more convenient. Try products and choose what convinces you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBleach food containers with deep tomato stains. Tomato pigments are hard to remove from plastic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse dishwasher salt. It is similar to table salt but purer, so it will not damage the appliance. It costs a bit more. Do not skimp.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf glasses turn cloudy, it could be manufacturing defects, deposits, or irreversible abrasion. If you notice permanent clouding, there is nothing to do; replace the glasses. You can try a different detergent and ensure you use rinse aid to help prevent it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"8-disinfectants\"\u003e8. Disinfectants\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese are tightly regulated devices. By law they must eliminate 99.99% of bacteria on a surface. There are complex requirements, but in general they must act quickly and not be toxic when used as directed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Focus on where to use them. Most transmission occurs, in order:\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhere food is handled (cutting boards, sponges)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEating with unwashed hands\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing toilets or changing a diaper\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCoughing/sneezing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther (in order: surfaces touched by a sick person, contaminated laundry, animals, trash, other infected people)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ As we see, floors and even dirty clothes are relatively low risk, since we do not eat off them. Disinfecting them constantly, unless there is an immunocompromised person, is wasteful, and microbes return within hours.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeveral forms exist: concentrates, sprays, wipes (convenient but less effective).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther substances can disinfect in principle, like hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, or bleach, but they are not formulated for this purpose on surfaces. If you have nothing else, OK, but purpose-made disinfectants are much more effective.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The best way to disinfect a sponge is the microwave. It kills the vast majority of microbes thanks to the high temperature and microwaves. Bressanini cites a study recommending placing the sponge in a vented container for one minute at maximum power.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDisinfectants kill molds, so they are recommended for cleaning the fridge and cutting boards. On moldy walls there is often little to do; spores can persist in porous surfaces.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The fear of pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables is generally overstated in Europe. Regulations are strict. Unless you are pregnant and need extra precautions, rinsing produce under running water is enough. In one study only about 1% of samples were above safety limits, and about 60% had no detectable residues.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"9-baking-soda\"\u003e9.

Nothing special.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCarpets and furniture: use specific products. For floors, a mop with an appropriate cleaner works well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Classic clogged drain: this happens because solid residues build up in the pipe (often food). In extreme cases you need a plumber (there must be at least a trickle of water; if totally blocked avoid forcing it). Before that, try in this order (ignore bad advice online; do not use baking soda):\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn acid to dissolve limescale: vinegar or citric acid is fine, better when warm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA couple of liters of hot water around 60 C to dissolve solidified grease\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCaustic soda (sodium hydroxide) for protein residues; many drain openers use this\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA plunger if it is still clogged\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"11-odors\"\u003e11.

Classic pH reminder: acids neutralize bases and vice versa. Always rinse afterward\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf odors persist, check the drip tray. You cannot access it easily, but let two or three drops of bleach run down to kill bacteria\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor shoes: if possible, wash them in the machine. A chemically sensible option is to use baking soda powder. Put in a heaping tablespoon and shake the shoe to spread it everywhere. Leave it for a full day, then shake out the powder and vacuum the inside. It will not neutralize every odor, since not all malodorous compounds are acidic, but it helps, though it is not a definitive solution.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kYXNlLOAL._SL1500_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/la-scienza-delle-pulizie/","title":"La Scienza Delle Pulizie"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eNice, not as good as La Scienza Delle Pulizie but still a good book.

You should keep vegetables in the lower humid drawer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTomatoes lose nutrients the longer they stay cold; better to keep them on the higher, warmer shelves if you refrigerate them at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePotatoes should not go in the fridge, ideally around 15 C.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEggs should never stay in the door rack; temperature swings can cause microfractures.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo defrost, it is better to put food in the fridge at 4 C, or under a stream of cold water. The microwave is not ideal because it does not heat evenly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"microwave\"\u003eMicrowave\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA very useful tool that does more than just heat water in food. The microwaves bounce inside the metal box, generating heat, but not perfectly evenly. Some parts heat a bit more, which is why there is usually a rotating plate.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor example, you can cook (with a little water) vegetables like zucchini, potatoes, peppers, carrots, broccoli, onions, and squash with great results, keeping some crunch and avoiding bad smells.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn reality it has a fixed power (often about 600 W). When you set a lower power, it simply cycles off for some milliseconds to reduce the average heat.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot recommended for foods low in water (like stale bread). If you heat foods that absorb little, a good trick is to put a glass of water inside to absorb some of the waves, which could otherwise stress the appliance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"vegetables\"\u003eVegetables\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧅 Onion: a trick to stop tears is to wet the knife to reduce the impact of its enzymes, and do not face the cut side toward you (dice starting from the far side).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧄 Garlic: the enzyme that creates the smell reacts only when we cut or crush garlic. Avoid pre-minced garlic, which has lost its fresh aroma. Very healthy food (as he says for all vegetables). Do not crush it if you want a milder aroma. It can be stored in a cool, dark place for months.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍅 Tomato: technically a berry, and beyond the fun facts about its nature and flavor it keeps well at 13 to 22 C; in the fridge it loses a lot of aroma over time. If possible, keep it somewhere cool rather than cold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫑 Peppers: a trick is to soften them a bit in the microwave, sliced, since they contain a lot of water, then finish in a pan with oil and garlic. They do not tolerate cold very well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍏 Apples and other climacteric fruits like apricot, banana, pear, and tomato ripen based on ethylene, a signal that tells them to soften, turning starches into sugars. If an apple gets bruised, it darkens and, under stress, can release ethylene to the others, making them ripen and soften.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌵 Asparagus: best eaten just after harvest or soon after buying, since they keep growing fast, getting tougher and losing sugars. If it bends past 90 degrees it is not fresh; it should not be too flexible. The microwave is highly recommended to trap their flavorful juices inside and not lose them (3 to 4 minutes at 800 W). And yes, there is at least one molecule that makes them smell a bit because it is similar to what we use to odorize gas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌿 Basil: cut it chiffonade (roll the leaves, then slice into thin strips), great for salads with tomato. The best way is to buy a small plant to keep on the balcony, cutting stems and leaves 10 to 15 cm from the base, leaving two to four pairs to regrow. This way you get fresh basil for the whole summer. In the fridge it suffers from the cold; it is better to slice it and freeze it in a small bag (it will turn black, a cosmetic process similar to our tanning, but it keeps its aroma). You can also dry it in the microwave.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥕 Carrots: originally yellow and purple until the 1600s, then a genetic mutation led to the selection of orange ones, which were more convenient (purple ones colored broth purple and you could not see anything). Purple ones are called black carrots and are used a lot as a colorant.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫒 Oil: you can make it from many foods, olive, soy, sunflower, etc., and they are more or less interchangeable because there is no single specific molecule. They contain the same fatty acids, bound in triglycerides, in different percentages. We simplify to plant = unsaturated and animal = saturated, but not always true. Those are not interchangeable: they have different chemical properties, so replace saturated with saturated, especially in desserts. Virgin oils are made only with mechanical processes, with no chemical changes, and extra virgin have low free acids (less bitter flavor). Use extra virgin olive oil raw, and seed oils for frying and sauteing if possible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍆 Eggplant: it suffers from cold, so do not keep it too long in the fridge. Choose ones that spring back when pressed. Avoid a brown cap, which means it is old. Frying is tricky; better to give it a quick pass in the microwave for a couple of minutes so it does not absorb too much water and oil.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥔 Potatoes: store outside the fridge in the dark; watch light exposure, which causes solanine production, which is toxic. For mash, better to use a ricer than a blender, which breaks too many starch chains and makes it gluey. Boil potatoes with the skin; they absorb less water and keep a bit more nutrients. You can microwave them before frying, with a lid to increase effectiveness.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BbeRJiMPL._SL1203_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/la-scienza-delle-verdure/","title":"La Scienza Delle Verdure"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe author, a journalist for La Repubblica, writes in a slightly too novelistic way but effectively; the book kept me hooked for three straight days.

How do you find the parent and display the whole thread while scaling well? The default choice is an adjacent list with a parent key, self-joining. But it scales poorly for the most common case: reconstructing the entire thread. Be careful with nested trees. A path approach is often the least painful even if not optimal, or nodes. Recursive queries are the best if your database supports them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"id-required\"\u003eID Required\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConventions are good only if they are helpful.\nCommon case: everyone uses id as the primary key by convention, but who says you must? Better to use an id with a meaningful name like bug_id or technician_id and enforce the key on that column. It might even be a composite key (bug_id, technician_id), making a generic id column useless. If you have a framework like Prisma that expects an id, keep it. But be smart and deliberate with keys. The id convention can hide the real meaning of keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"keyless-entry\"\u003eKeyless Entry\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake your database mistake-proof with constraints.\nThe antipattern is assuming input data maintains referential integrity, when in fact anything can happen: orphan rows, duplicates, and so on. Foreign keys are important because they block bad data at insert time. The tradeoff is you cannot remove or update a parent row without addressing the children, which often discourages their use. You see this antipattern when you find orphaned rows and automated checks for inconsistencies. The solution is to view foreign keys as ways to keep dirty data out in the first place, not as limitations. You can also assign cascading updates/deletes for efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"entity-attribute-value\"\u003eEntity-Attribute-Value\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse metadata for metadata.\nAvoid a generic attribute table. It seems clever for a flexible schema, but it is not. Those name-value tables let you put anything in. You cannot enforce required attributes, you cannot use proper data types if everything is a string, and you end up doing outer joins to fetch everything. Extensibility hurts usability. Use NoSQL if you truly need flexibility, or add a type column to identify the object type and allow many null columns. That is fine. If you need rigidity, use Single Table Inheritance.

For example, a comment belongs to either a bug or a feature request. How do you enforce that? The antipattern is adding issue_type, mixing metadata with data. Then you do a Select * where issue_type = \u0026ldquo;Bugs\u0026rdquo;. The problem is it allows associations you do not want (like a comment without a valid parent). Solutions are either a bridge table (sometimes overkill) or using COALESCE with multiple joins to find the first non-null match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"multicolumn-attributes\"\u003eMulticolumn Attributes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStore each value with the same meaning in a single column.\nExample: phone numbers.

Indexes help. The \u0026ldquo;tribbles\u0026rdquo; example is tables like Bugs_2009 and Bugs_2008, which create integrity, query, and synchronization problems.

Immutable sets tend to mutate. Do not hardcode allowed values at creation time or with CHECK constraints if they will evolve, because maintenance becomes hard. Use ENUM only if you are certain the set is immutable.

If you apply functions to the leftmost column, that index will not be used (same for LIKE \u0026lsquo;%\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;). Use EXPLAIN and profilers to see how queries run.

Laying Plans\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s start by saying that Modeling is the projection of business requirements. Having a clear and structured model is the key to a reliable database, keeping in mind that it is still an approximation of reality and no size fits all. We just want to avoid unmanageable queries.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNormalization is a logical process for data modeling, to be strictly followed when laying down the schema of a DB and minimizing inconsistency: 3 steps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnsure Atomicity -\u0026gt; use IDs instead of descriptions/names to identify rows. You have to make sure that searching for, say, the customer, returns all the rows without worrying about misspelling or slow \u0026ldquo;like\u0026rdquo; statements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Dependence on the Whole Key -\u0026gt; keep columns to a limit: e.g. if the same car models share the same information about car details, move them to another table that can be joined through the car model key. Don\u0026rsquo;t keep redundant data in the main table for performance reasons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Attribute Independence -\u0026gt; separate the independent attributes, for example country code details, which can be stored in another table connected through a non primary key to the row. This further minimizes data redundancy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention with nulls: a red flag is when the majority of the columns contain null values, and if two columns can\u0026rsquo;t both be not null at the same time. Also, avoid using this kind of statement where color not in (\u0026lsquo;BLUE\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;BLACK\u0026rsquo;, null) because the engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what NULL is so there may be bugs (check with MSSQL though). In general, avoid nulls.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTuning is about getting the best possible performance now. When we develop, we must have a different mindset and not think \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s code it, and then have a specialist tune it later in production.\u0026rdquo; Focus on not making a bad model, which is the main cause of poor performance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving different sources can be a performance killer, in addition to making the system more complex and difficult to maintain. Try to insert some rows locally and then through a DB Link. Centralizing data should be a key priority. The nearer you are to your data, the faster you can get at it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-waging-war\"\u003e2. Waging War\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key topic of this chapter is that SQL is a declarative language, so keep it separate from the procedural nature of business specifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen running long and complex processes, identifying when a query is used can be difficult. Leave comments in the code to explain where the code is used to help identify and track down issues. Make the statements identifiable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA database connection is fundamentally a heavy, high-resource operation. Don\u0026rsquo;t do as in the example where for each line it was opening a connection. Try to insert data in chunks to maximize speed. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale well for updates; better use one set-based statement to outperform them all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStand back from your problem and possibly tackle the challenge with a fresh mind. Sometimes a different angle can dramatically fix a problem, such as a performance issue optimized with a UNION.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaximize each visit to the database by asking for all the columns you will need in one single statement, even if you are not using them all immediately. If you have to retrieve different values (e.g. max and min date) don\u0026rsquo;t use two statements.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing the DB native kernel and functions provided by the DBMS is generally faster than building abstraction layers on top of it (e.g. PL/SQL is slower than a SQL function).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid counting rows if not necessary (classic select count(*) into counter from table_name where \u0026lt;certain_condition\u0026gt; if (counter \u0026gt; 0) then \u0026hellip;). It is more performant to use native tools like @@ROWCOUNT or SQL%ROWCOUNT or MERGE when inserting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are several ways to achieve procedural logic in a DB application. Even if it is conceptually better to leave it at application level, leaving some logic in SQL can be faster. Loops don\u0026rsquo;t exist in SQL as it works on sets, and if conditions are the WHERE clauses. For else-like cases you can use CASE.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuccessive updates to a single table are acceptable only if they affect different rows. Otherwise, combine the updates to use the full power of indexes and avoid unnecessary visits.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid lookup functions when you can use joins. Readability can decrease, but the optimizer can\u0026rsquo;t examine the functions and performance is worse.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-tactical-dispositions\"\u003e3.

The performance decrease of one trigger is comparable to adding two indexes (Oracle).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are not a panacea. To justify the use of an index, it must provide benefit (including indexing foreign keys, that some systems do automatically but which can cause locks and redundancy). The most efficient index is a unique one, with one row = one index value.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you apply a function to an indexed column (formatting, truncating a date, anything) the query will work but you will lose the advantages of the index.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSystem-generated incremental keys are an easy way to assign IDs, but can be a bottleneck in case of concurrent inserts, as there is one centralized generator assigning values to everyone. Reverse Keys or Hash Indexes were introduced to alleviate the load, but they have limitations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-maneuvering\"\u003e4.

The optimizer examines the available indexes, the physical layout of data, how much memory is available, processors, and so on, and decides the strategy. Its task is to go from what to how.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo most of the work in the relational layer and leave the rest to the optimizer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are five main factors to consider when dealing with SQL:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe size of the tables we are querying\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe criteria required to define the result set (see Filtering)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe size of the result set\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe number of tables to be processed (pay attention to views on top of tables, hiding complexity)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe number of concurrent users\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFiltering: prioritize WHERE clauses that cut out as much data as possible first, to optimize the query. The sooner we get rid of unnecessary data the less we have to process later.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention to DISTINCT, which can hide overlooked joins and is difficult to debug if you are missing data. Only add it when you are sure you are gathering all the data. Use IN or EXISTS instead (test which is faster).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNotable example of a subquery joining two correlated subqueries (and (os.ordid, os.statusdate) = (select ordid, max(statusdate) from orderstatus group by ordid)). If we used o.ordid the optimizer wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the freedom to choose whether to scan both tables, so ideally you should use identifiers from one table to give more independence (and, if correct, speed it up).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid indexes if the query returns a lot of data (there is no specific rule anymore, just keep this in mind).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-terrain\"\u003e5.

Better to use upper and lower bounds\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you have dynamic inputs that could be null (e.g. a movie DB) you need dynamic queries. But watch for injection, use parameters\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t trust unit tests. With or without an index it may seem the same because it\u0026rsquo;s fast, but one does 5k queries per second and the other 25. Think about that too. In his example, a noticeable problem is something at 10000 requests per second anyway; it depends, but it\u0026rsquo;s not my case right now\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can do little about locks, but limit large updates if you know there are reads at the same time, and of course optimize the updates (e.g. truncate instead of delete if clearing the table, roll back ASAP, limit loops, use stored procedures)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause truncate bypasses so much of the work that delete performs, you should use caution. The use of truncate may impact your backups, and it may also have other side effects, such as the invalidation of some indexes. Any use of truncate should always be discussed with your DBAs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Unconventional\u0026rdquo; designs such as attribute/attribute value columns are often used to simplify schema construction, but the queries are a mess.

It goes deeper into black holes and the universe. It really does that and goes deep into the subject, explaining black hole evaporation, why Hawking\u0026rsquo;s assumptions are so unsettling, with solid physics foundations and deep dives into string theory and the holographic principle. I admit I got lost toward the end, it gets very technical, but it stays approachable on many other topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not sure I would recommend it. He tries to challenge Hawking, but I did not really grasp his arguments; they are very theoretical, and he ends up suggesting that information can leave black holes in some universes, not all. I struggled to follow parts of it. The question remains open. What is valuable is the early overview of the subject and the precise explanations of various points. A book for physicists. Fortunately I had some background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt times the arguments feel overly elaborate. The author\u0026rsquo;s barbs at Hawking can be distracting (even if they are friends).

Note how it becomes harder to follow toward the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 1 - In 1981, Hawking postulates that information is lost in black holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2 - Black holes and the horizon at the Schwarzschild radius described. Einstein rejected black holes. Tidal forces are less at the horizon of large black holes. Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equivalence principle states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3 - Riemann proposed that space may be curved, an idea incorporated into general relativity. Minkowski space incorporates space and time, with a world line representing the path of an object. Einstein discovered time dilation where rapidly moving clocks slow down. General relativity states that objects move along geodesics in spacetime. If space is curved, the object follows the curvature. Gravitational force is the curvature of spacetime. John Wheeler proposed wormholes but they would stay open for so short a time that even light could not pass through. Einstein discovered gravitational redshift where clocks slow down near a heavy mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4 - Duality of light - not only wavelike but particle-like - Einstein 1905. Planck\u0026rsquo;s constant h ~ 6.62 x 10^-34 J s. Information conservation, or reversibility, states that given the present, one can construct the future and the past. Quantum mechanics respects the conservation of information. Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s uncertainty principle states that the greater the certainty of velocity, the lesser the certainty of position. m delta v delta x \u0026gt; h. When a system is deprived of all energy it is in ground state. QM, however, states that particles are still in motion - zero point motion or the quantum jitters. Energy of a photon E = h f. In quantum field theory, the path of a particle is a propagator. A split, such as in the release of a particle, is a vertex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5 - Planck found that if c, G (Newton\u0026rsquo;s gravitational constant) and h are set to one, three fundamental Planck units result. The Planck length is very small (10^-35 m), much smaller than a proton. Planck time (10^-42 s) is very small, being the time it takes light to traverse the Planck length. Planck mass is about that of a dust mote. The energy equivalent is about equal to a tank of gasoline. The Planck length, time and mass are the size, half-life and mass of the smallest possible black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6 - The question of how black holes decay. A possibility is that quantum fluctuations would allow a piece of the horizon to fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7 - Equivalence of chemical, potential, kinetic and thermal energy. Conservation of energy is the First Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law states that entropy always increases. Entropy is a measure of the number of arrangements that conform to some specific recognizable criterion. Entropy is hidden information. Entropy increases because we lose track of the details over time. The smallest size containing a bit of information is a Planck length. Maximum amount of information that can be put into a region of space is equal to the area of the region, not the volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8 - John Wheeler stated that black holes have no hair, meaning the horizon was smooth. Adding one bit of information to a black hole increases its horizon by one square Planck length. Entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9 - Black holes have temperature which is inversely proportional to their size. Black holes are black bodies - they reflect no light. Black holes emit photons and therefore evaporate. A black hole the mass of the moon would be 1 K. One the mass of a boulder would be a billion billion degrees. Photon emission from a BH is Hawking radiation. Hawking calculates that the entropy of a BH equals one quarter of the horizon area, measured in Planck units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10 - Hawking states that when a BH evaporates, the trapped bits of information disappear from the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11 - Particle collisions are described by an S or scattering matrix, which is reversible. Hawking invented the not-S matrix or dollar matrix which is not reversible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12 - Surrounding space is warmer than astronomical BHs, so they are still gathering mass rather than evaporating, although the evaporation rate is very slow. Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equivalence principle - the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13 - Susskind\u0026rsquo;s Antigravity Pill paradox where characters fall through a BH horizon. Apparently they are destroyed and emitted as evaporation products as required by QM. But apparently they also pass safely through the horizon as predicted by the equivalence principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14 - The possibility that a BH horizon is covered with quantum copying machines so that evaporation and passage are both possible. However, a quantum copying machine is not possible as it would violate Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s uncertainty principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15 - A BH stretched horizon is one Planck distance above the horizon. It is an energetic, hot layer. Susskind proposes complementarity whereby both alternatives of the paradox are true. No paradox because the observers on the inside and outside can never meet, so each story is true in its own zone of reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16 - It requires increasingly short wavelength (high energy) photons to observe smaller particles. As an atom falls closer to a horizon, it requires increasingly high energy photons to resolve them. So as the atom falls to the horizon, it becomes increasingly blurred and appears to spread out over the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17 - About Cambridge, religion and Hawking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18 - The Holographic Principle - the contents of space are actually a holographic representation of the information on the area bounding that space. Perhaps all space and the universe is a hologram, coded on a distant two dimensional space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19 - String theory - we do not know whether this model actually represents the real world. However, it is consistent with the real world and does allow theories to be tested for consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadrons are nucleons, mesons and glueballs. Nucleons are protons and neutrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you spin a nucleon, the energy increases in proportion to the angular momentum, but in steps. An electron cannot be spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnergetic nucleons are stringlike objects, made up of quarks and gluons. The simplest hadron is a meson, composed of a quark and an anti-quark joined by a stringlike gluon. Open strings, such as mesons, have ends, but there can also be closed strings. Nucleons are 3 quarks joined by a Y shaped string. Another hadron, the closed string or glueball, has no quarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mathematical theory of quarks and gluons is quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks are elementary particles with six flavors - up, down, strange, charmed, bottom and top. All quarks come in three colors - blue, green and red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGluons have positive and negative poles, and each has a color - R, B or G. Therefore, nine types of gluon are possible. The propagator of a gluon has two sides corresponding to the two poles - each side is R, B or G. At a vertex, or split, each side must be consistent - e.g. a BR can split into BG - GR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile string theory applied to hadrons is well accepted, fundamental strings associated with gravity at Planck scales are not. The graviton is the primary fundamental string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrical and gravitational forces create waves. Hence, gravitational waves. Gravitons are conjecture. Any particle can emit a graviton, even other gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly, fundamental and QCD strings are the same objects at different scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamental strings require 9 dimensions. The 6 extra dimensions are compacted into geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeynman theorized that electrical force is due to particles continually emitting and absorbing photons - photon exchange. Also, all matter continually emits and absorbs gravitons. Fundamental strings spawn off and absorb tiny strings - these are the gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe string theory of gravity is not fully described but appears to be the best mathematical model of quantum gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20 - As things slow down, more structure comes into view. Much structure cannot be seen due to cosmic jitter. Perhaps particles are much larger than thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21 - Going up the mass scale beyond elementary particles are conjectural collections called superpartners, grand unification partners and string excitations. These range to the Planck mass. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) should see superpartners. T\u0026rsquo; Hooft speculates that the spectrum of particles extends beyond the Planck mass in the form of black holes. A 1 kg BH is a trillion times smaller than a proton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings, such as those making up photons, have temperature and entropy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entropy of a BH is proportional to the area of the horizon, and therefore the square of the mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings can cross each other, normally passing through each other. A small probability (the string coupling constant) exists that they split and re-arrange. This is how small strings are formed at a horizon, producing Hawking radiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an electron is dropped into a BH, the BH becomes charged. A charge on a BH pushes the horizon out from the singularity. If enough charge exists to balance gravity, you have an extremal BH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolchinski discovered D-branes, a membrane on which fundamental strings can end. These turn out to fill a large mathematical hole in string theory. The use of D-5 branes for the extra dimensions, D-1 branes for the normal dimensions, and fundamental strings allowed the math to be developed for an extremal BH showing that the entropy = one quarter of the horizon area. Also allowed the math of the evaporation process to be developed. This clinched the argument that BH are storage containers for information, not eaters of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22 - De Sitter space is a four dimensional (4 + 1) space with positive curvature that satisfies Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equations. It is becoming important in cosmology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti-de Sitter (AdS) space is similar, but with negative curvature. The spacetime curvature in AdS creates a gravitational field that pulls objects back to the center even if there is nothing there. If matter is added to an AdS space, a BH trapped in the space (like a box) results - a BTZ black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings on a stack of D-branes are governed by the same rules as those that govern gluons in QCD. Maldacena showed that a three dimensional world with gravity is equivalent to a two dimensional quantum hologram on the boundary of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitten showed that a BH in AdS must be equivalent to something on the surface bounding the space - a hot fluid of gluons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23 - The Holographic Principle states that everything that takes place in AdS (4+1) is describable by a mathematical theory with fewer dimensions. Quantum gravity in AdS is mathematically equivalent to QCD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an AdS space is modified to a Q space with both a UV (small scale) brane and an IR (large scale) brane, particles near the UV brane act like fundamental strings while those near the IR brane act like nuclear particles. The possibility is that fundamental particles and nuclear particles are really the same objects in different areas of space. The hot quark soup produced in nuclear collision events has an unexpected very low viscosity, as does a BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuclear physics may allow string theory to be tested. Conversely, string theory may be applicable to nuclear events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24 - It appears that the cosmological constant is non zero - 10^-123 in Planck units. Einstein had originally included an extra term in his equations, called the cosmological term. The constant (Greek lambda) creates a repulsive force if negative; attractive if positive. Eventually, Einstein set it to zero, eliminating it from his equations, and calling it his biggest mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cosmic horizon exists at 15 billion light years where the universe is receding from Earth at the speed of light. This cosmic horizon may be analogous to a BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91sFJSxkM6L._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/the-black-hole-war/","title":"The Black Hole War"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eA classic, recommended after the good experience with Antifragile. I have to say I enjoyed it slightly more, but Taleb, even though he writes in a fairly amusing and light way, becomes really monotonous after a while. I struggle with him over the long run. His thoughts mostly refer to a business sphere where statisticians have created very complex models (starting from the Gaussian, his number one enemy) in economics, but it can be applied in everyday life. It depends on the category: you will not have a Black Swan in the average height of the population (Mediocristan), but you can have it in the sales of a book (Extremistan).

Economic crises, eruptions, earthquakes, sales records, scientific breakthroughs, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExploration of our biases: for example, in hindsight we think Black Swans were predictable, but in truth we cannot predict them. The turkey story is exemplary: every day it receives food and thinks it will always be that way, until Christmas day when everything ends abruptly. In hindsight we understand it was predictable, but for the poor turkey the Black Swan was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother example: when markets go up, the news will say it is thanks to X; if they go down, it is always X\u0026rsquo;s fault (it was something like the arrest of Saddam Hussein). A huge bias we have. Explaining black swans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the gist is: do not fall into the fallacy of creating explanations for what happens; major events are unpredictable. So all the statistical theories, the Gaussian distributions he criticizes, and various models are only approximations of reality that will fail at the next unexpected event. (very controversial, I see, but it makes sense)\nMissing a train is only painful if you run after it, if you allow yourself to care. avoid trying to predict the future and live it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else can you do? Well, do not get into areas where you need an unexpected event to break through (writer, chef, etc.), Taleb advises, and above all you can make a 90% safe mix and small bets that, if they catch a black swan, give you great upside (he calls it the barbell strategy, more of a financial thing).\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IebQqqWtL.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/the-black-swan/","title":"The Black Swan"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eChosen somewhat at random, it is a read I am glad I undertook, though very long.

It does not reason over the set, but row by row. If our 10 products each have a 50% margin, the total will be 50 * 10 -\u0026gt; 500%.

ALL ignores any active filter in the report and is useful when computing ratios and % of total, because the user might have filtered something. It returns a list of unique values, requires a table or list of columns, and cannot be an expression; if you use it with more than one column it shows all combinations present in the data. ALLEXCEPT can be used like \u0026ldquo;take everything from that table except those columns\u0026rdquo;.

So TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount]) will be 30M if shown in a card with no filters, maybe 1M if only Australia is selected, or 30k in a table split by brand, but it is always the same measure.

By using the row context, which is essentially a cursor.\nIf you write Gross Margin as a measure, you lose the row context of the calculated column, so you need an iterator with X; Gross Margin := SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * (Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost])) works because it uses the SUMX iterator, which maintains context. Instead, Gross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * (Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost]) is invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-notes\"\u003eOther notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt continues with many interesting examples about the difficulty of understanding the two contexts, especially in filters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen functions iterate in two different contexts, there is the EARLIER function to consider the outer layer. It is somewhat tricky; the example in the book shows how the switch works. It corresponds in some way to Python\u0026rsquo;s super(). The book itself suggests using variables instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that row context iterates a single table, it does not filter, and therefore it cannot use relationships without RELATED/RELATEDTABLE. A filter context, instead, uses relationships automatically and behaves differently depending on direction (single or both, see chapter 15).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery interesting example with SUMMARIZE when computing average customer age without counting duplicates: the code shows how to include a different column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCALCULATE is the most powerful and important function in DAX and the one with more facets to discover. CALCULATETABLE is similar but returns a table. Their complexity comes from the fact that they are the only ones that create new filters, and therefore modify the filter context from chapter 4. The authors recommend re-reading the chapter carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe formula is CALCULATE(Expression, Condition1, \u0026hellip; ConditionN), accepting any expression as the required first parameter, and then n filters. For filters, which are tables/lists of values, you can use an expression \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso\u0026rdquo; which is equivalent to FILTER(ALL(\u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand]), \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso\u0026rdquo;). For readability, prefer the compact version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, CALCULATE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMakes a copy of the existing filter context\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvaluates each filter in its args and, for each condition, produces a list of valid values for the specified column (in the example, it will be {\u0026ldquo;Contoso\u0026rdquo;}). It is equivalent to a FILTER ALL (remember)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf two or more filters target the same column, they are merged with an AND\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUses the new condition to replace existing filters or adds it to the context if none exist\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf there is a row context, applies a Context Transition by turning it into a filter context and removing the existing one\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen finished, applies the new filter context to the model, and once computed it returns to the original context. It is not a permanent change\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery important: because CALCULATE uses a FILTER(ALL) behind the scenes, if you want to avoid removing all filters you must use the extended form of the condition, and use VALUES if you want to preserve current filters from other tables, for example. The chapter shows an interesting case with a ratio where the Sales table is filtered, while the Date table must keep its filters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filtering-with-complex-conditions\"\u003eFiltering with complex conditions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is an example with a slicer that tries to filter a CALCULATE, but since the compact form uses ALL it gets ignored. You need to wrap the filter condition in KEEPFILTERS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"context-transition\"\u003eContext Transition\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCALCULATE invalidates any row context. It automatically adds as filter arguments all the columns that are currently being iterated in any row context—filtering their actual value in the row being iterated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, CALCULATE uses the row context as a filter in the filter context, because by itself row context is not an iterator. This is a transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat example to review context. The formula Sum Num Of Sales := SUMX(Sales, COUNTROWS(Sales)) surprisingly returns COUNTROWS squared; the number of Contoso rows is 37,000, for example, and SUMX iterates 37,000 times, so it will return 37,000 * 37,000 because it is reasoning in row context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother example: Sales Amount := SUMX(Sales, CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]))). The point is that CALCULATE is creating filters row by row because it follows the row context in SUMX, so it will do Tot = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Product] = \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;) + CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Product] = \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;) \u0026hellip; etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContext transition (CT) is costly. Use CALCULATE sparingly, because in iterations it will apply the filter for each row\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT does not filter only one row, as you might think. The new transitioned filter filters all rows with the same value. So if in the example above we have Sales[Product] = \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;, there might be multiple results depending on the input data\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT uses columns not present in the formula\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT creates a filter context starting from a row context\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT occurs when there is a row context (so in iterators and calculated columns). Note that measures implicitly have a CALCULATE too\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT transforms all row contexts, without exceptions and without a way to stop it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCT invalidates any existing row context, once the transition is applied\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, CT does not filter just one row but reasons on unique values, so we can get tricky errors in tables without unique values. Using this tactic is not only wrong, but also very slow because it must iterate over millions of rows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a measure is also wrong, because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever you read a measure call in DAX, you should always read it as if CALCULATE were there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery measure hides a CALCULATE that wraps its expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"calculate-modifiers-see-also-chapter-14\"\u003eCALCULATE modifiers (see also chapter 14)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUSERELATIONSHIP, used in edge cases, for example if you have an Order Date and a Delivery Date you might have two relationships with the Date table, one active by default and one inactive. Adding USERELATIONSHIP(Key1, Key2) inside CALCULATE tells it to use the inactive one for this calculation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCROSSFILTER, similar but more powerful: it can disable a relationship between tables and change its direction; it has a third parameter (NONE, ONEWAY, BOTH). Personally, never used\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKEEPFILTERS: instead of VALUES, another way to keep current filters is KEEPFILTERS, e.g. Audio Sales KeepFilters := CALCULATE([Sales Amount], KEEPFILTERS(\u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Category] = \u0026ldquo;Audio\u0026rdquo;)). Instead of overwriting the filter context, it adds the condition with an AND, so cells included in the function show a number and the others are BLANK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eALL: behaves differently when used inside CALCULATE. It becomes a sort of REMOVEFILTER and cancels the effect of KEEPFILTERS, so it can ignore additional filters added in the function. All modifiers are computed with higher priority than normal filters\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eALLSELECTED: similar to ALL, it also behaves differently in this case; see chapter 14 as it can be dangerous, so try to avoid it unless you know exactly what you are doing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"6--variables\"\u003e6 ✨ Variables\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are important for code readability and performance, avoiding repetition.

Use long, meaningful names. DAX, for example, often prefixes internal names with two __\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"7--working-with-iterators-and-with-calculate\"\u003e7 🔄 Working with iterators and with CALCULATE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost iterators require a table and an expression that will be evaluated row by row for that table (see the classic SUMX). Specifically, they iterate all rows collecting the value, and then apply an operation, in this case a sum. The difference between iterators is therefore the final operation; the flow is always the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnow this: iterator cardinality is the number of rows scanned by the iterator. Avoid nesting several iterations and making cardinality grow exponentially; keep it low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chapter continues with interesting examples, such as how to compute the day with the largest Sales by nesting MAXX and SUMX, or showing the list of visible colors using CONCATENATEX and VALUES, how ALLSELECTED makes more sense with RANKX when the user is filtering, and how AVERAGEX should be replaced by DIVIDE when there are BLANKs because it handles them correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"8--time-intelligence-calculations\"\u003e8 🔄 Time Intelligence Calculations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery interesting chapter, because dates in DAX are managed in a not always intuitive way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA golden tip is to always have a Date table related to all others to operate on dates, in order to optimize performance, improve the experience, and simplify the structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default Power BI creates a hidden date table for each column in the model of type Date or DateTime, so you can slice by year, quarter, month, day, etc. Unfortunately this means you have one table per column, creating overhead, and you cannot see or modify them.

That is odd: if we truly cared, we would want to know whether the money is used well. This is because 1) we see it as distant, so we care less, and 2) we do it to show the world we are good (otherwise donations would be anonymous).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEducation: if top colleges wanted to help more students, they would expand slots. They cost more because they are limited, not because the teaching is necessarily better (but the network is, see the stats). School also teaches you to adapt and be measured, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Medicine: stuffing ourselves with medicine and going to the doctor for every little thing is a classic way to show we are trying and took action. Medicine can be an elaborate \u0026ldquo;kiss it better.\u0026rdquo; Various studies show that spending more does not improve survival odds, but when we are ill we do not think that way; we want the best right away. If we want to live long it is better not to smoke, drink less, eat well, exercise, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReligion: more than religion itself, people are united by the beliefs, rituals, and norms of their community.

It makes me eager to train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou need to understand the scientific fundamentals to build the right strategy. But for a beginner, just showing up is great. Science suggests 30 to 60 minutes of resistance training per week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny training is better than no training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJeff distinguishes between compound exercises (deadlift, squat, bench press) and isolation ones. Compound lifts are harder, but they move many muscles at once. You need to make a trade-off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWatch out for pain. Lifting is very safe, but if you feel persistent pain, reduce the load for a couple of weeks or rest.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Control the negative. The movement should be strong both on the way down and on the way up, so you use your strength fully. Always controlled. Deep stretch at the bottom and full squeeze at the top. If you control the negative, time does not matter. You can take 2 or 8 seconds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe weight must be appropriate. Jeff dives into the details, but 6 to 15 reps works. Fewer if you really want to focus on strength, more for detail work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The limit is often mental. Your brain does not think you can do another rep. Think of being in a high-pressure test and push for one more. That is your real limit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to measure progress? Bodyweight is usually misleading. Take a mirror photo every month; muscles are a visual result. Weight and body fat are context. If you play the long game, strength, photos, and weight together are good pivots.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnother mental trick: bundle something you do not like (e.g., cardio) with something you enjoy (listening to new music). Worth keeping in mind.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ You usually give your best on the first exercise, with fresh muscles. If you want to improve something specific, put it first. Do compound/primary lifts first for this reason, since they are more complete.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSimple breathing: breathe in on the negative. Breathe out on the positive.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e[Long list of exercises with step-by-step guidance.

They will not grow muscle optimally. DON\u0026rsquo;T UNDERTRAIN.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to avoid it? Push until you physically cannot move or you start to cheat. Form comes first. Failure training means just that. Push to the point of failure: it is the most efficient and effective way to maximize muscle growth. The logic is simple: if the muscle gets used to a given level of stress, it stops growing. You must keep stimulating it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ That does not mean do it all the time. He explains a method: on average, stop 0 to 3 reps shy of failure. It is called RIR.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e[Various calculations to increase weight progressively; my app is working quite well for now]\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Frequency: 10 sets per month per muscle group for a beginner. Even 1 to 4 helps just to start. The number of reps is not important as long as you go to failure and stay between 6 and 15.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Workout splits: there is full body, single muscle group, and variations. I like push/pull/legs (chest, shoulders, and triceps vs back, biceps, and forearms vs quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and adductors), a nice split. But there is no strict rule.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRest is not overly important. Rest between sets just enough to recover calmly, 30 seconds to 1 minute.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e[Advanced techniques, skipping for now]\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn vacation, do not stress; the gym will be there when you return. Try something different to stay active: run, walk, swim.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiet: what matters is energy balance over time. If you are above maintenance, you gain weight; below, you lose weight. Focus on the trend.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDrinking is not particularly harmful; 1 or 2 beers occasionally is fine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFood before the workout is better, like a good breakfast. There are various studies and techniques, but do not overthink it. A good, abundant pre-workout meal. Protein is always better; before or after changes little.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProtein supplements are recommended, as are caffeine (in moderation; I personally skip it) and creatine, but none are essential.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCardio is good, but it does not build muscle effectively; it is more for losing body fat. Do at most 10 minutes before the workout, or do it after. It is not even an excellent fat-loss tool because your body adapts and burns less with habit. Actually, lifting weights burns a lot of energy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The less active you are outside the gym, the more cardio will help you anyway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/j88AAeSwIp9nmXOv/s-l960.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/the-muscle-ladder/","title":"The Muscle Ladder"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI already know it is five stars, I remember starting it before 2020, and it got me interested in mathematics and this fascinating mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReread in September and I liked it a lot, I understood better how the Riemann hypothesis works and the impact it has in the real world (especially on cryptography and other theories).

He focuses on himself, on being happy with the small daily moments, which are always unique and unmissable, and on rigorous self-care, starting with meditation.

It will be something different, outside the usual patterns.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtending old patterns for creating wealth leads to damage, not improvement. Resources are limited, and improving technology is how we improve the world.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeek the contrarian truth: always ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;what is a popular belief everyone holds that you disagree with\u0026rdquo;? How can you use it to your advantage? And pursue it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMonopoly advantages: they have their market and lead it. Aim to become one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGood perspective on the dot-com mania: before it there were crises in Russia and Japan, inflation, a rough period. People went all-in on tech because that was what looked possible. Always keep perspective.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLessons from the dot-com bubble:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake incremental advances Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStay lean and flexible All companies must be \u0026ldquo;lean,\u0026rdquo; which is code for \u0026ldquo;unplanned.\u0026rdquo; You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, \u0026ldquo;iterate,\u0026rdquo; and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImprove on the competition Don\u0026rsquo;t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFocus on product, not sales If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u0026rsquo;s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not do the restaurant model; it does not scale. Do not focus on being 10% better than others. Either 10x, or it is not worth it and you will fight over competition.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExample: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto; rap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks. Not good. Use unions: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeople on the autism spectrum may be advantaged: they are less sensitive to social cues, so they think independently and avoid herd behavior.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvery startup should start with a small market to dominate. For example, Amazon dominated online books. If you think your market is too big, it probably is.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEssay on definite/indefinite pessimism/optimism. He says the US are irrepressible optimists, which helps you jump in, and lately the indefinite kind matters. Knowing that one day things will be better and easier pushes you to create and experiment. You do not know when or what plan, so you move quickly without a detailed roadmap.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVCs know most of their companies will fail. They just need the one that returns 100x, so they only bet big.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThinking about it, it is tough. If you do not hit the next Uber, the fund often fails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving 0.01% of Google, for example, is very valuable. So make small investments in many things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLook for secrets: remember to ask what truth everyone takes for granted. Work around it, find a secret, work on it. In many fields, like medical, these secrets show up if you go deep and invest a lot. Not easy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA startup that starts poorly is hard to recover. You need solid foundations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot my favorite point, but understandable: everyone involved should work full time. Maximum commitment; no remote, no part time, no consultants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor example, at PayPal everyone was obsessed with creating a digital currency.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWithout a mission or a secret, you will not attract the best people to your startup. It is an art; you will find yours.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParadoxically, at PayPal many were similar, which let them start very quickly because they agreed on many things. This clashes with other books; likely context-dependent.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should feel like a tribe: less than a cult, but only a little less.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopers often think that because they built something cool, everyone will buy it. No. You need to sell (and sell yourself).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSalespeople are in a sense performers. We react poorly to those who do it badly. Good salespeople persuade you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDepending on your product\u0026rsquo;s price (very expensive → few deals → sales matter more to work the customer).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnother mistake developers (called nerds here) make: mistrusting the media. Too much media is not good, but selling yourself also means engaging with media.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLook around. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see any salespeople, you\u0026rsquo;re the salesperson.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnology will not replace humans: it will be complementary, as it has always been.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e7 questions to ask for a successful startup:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe People Question Do you have the right team?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don\u0026rsquo;t see?

Good analysis on cleantech, which missed things like 1, 5, 6.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTip: at their fund, they reportedly avoided CEOs in ties. The ones who build and get their hands dirty show up in jeans and a T-shirt; the others are mostly Sales.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFounders matter. Do not underestimate how much a single person can drive and change.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to - The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zGCdRQXOL._SL1200_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-how-to-build-the-future/","title":"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future"}]
