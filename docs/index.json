AI models are producing large amounts of boring, verbose, low-effort, LAZY content, and it is steadily flooding the web. Others, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zfN9wnPvU0\"\u003eKurzgesagt\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWpg1RmzAbc\"\u003eLast Week Tonight\u003c/a\u003e, have explored this more publicly, but the pattern is easy to recognise once you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it a few times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not against AI-generated content. It can be genuinely useful.\nI use it for drafts, quick exploration, and grammar checks. With some of my juniors, I even encourage generating bad code with AI and reviewing it together. All my blog posts go through an LLM to catch obvious mistakes, even though \u003cstrong\u003eevery single word is written by me\u003c/strong\u003e. And yes, the cover is from \u003ca href=\"https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/\"\u003eChatGPT Images\u003c/a\u003e, I think it did a great job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue is how people use AI for text, especially in 1:1 communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"personal-communication-is-different\"\u003ePersonal communication is different\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can argue endlessly about when and how AI should be used in daily work. But \u003cstrong\u003epersonal messages are different\u003c/strong\u003e. At the very least, they deserve a review before being sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you read AI slop, even if it is well masked, you can feel that something is off. The person does not talk like that. Verbs like \u003cem\u003edelve\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003epivotal\u003c/em\u003e, the overuse of bold text, lists, markdown, the bloody emojis, the pompous and verbose prose. The more you interact with an LLM, the more you recognise the way it talks. And you immediately notice, with a fair amount of false positives, when a message is AI-generated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing\"\u003ean extensive list of common signs of AI-generated writing on Wikipedia\u003c/a\u003e, which is worth reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-rule-that-matters\"\u003eThe rule that matters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a simple rule I once read in a CTO\u0026rsquo;s post and never forgot:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo not make people spend more time reading your content than you spent creating it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, this is not only annoying. It is a waste of my time and, in a subtle way, disrespectful. If a message is clearly unreviewed, it signals that the sender did not take the time to consider what they were sending. Communication is a delicate human skill, shaped over millennia, and neglecting it can erode attention, trust, and the quality of our interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also trains readers to disengage. For example, I already skip obvious AI-generated content on LinkedIn, and I am increasingly not replying to sloppy messages at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even read a likely \u003ca href=\"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/leading-effective-engineering-teams/\"\u003eAI-generated book by Addy Osmani\u003c/a\u003e, and that same \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; feeling was there for the entire reading.

We had already implemented a bunch of stability patches, but testing these trees was still a nightmare.\nOr was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"first-idea-brute-force-it\"\u003eFirst idea: brute-force it\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first idea was to just \u003cstrong\u003etry all the scenarios\u003c/strong\u003e. Loop through every combo of inputs and let the tool crash if something\u0026rsquo;s missing. Makes sense, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I created a script that isolates that part of the code, loads a random value for each conditions (e.g. a performance can be \u0026gt;0, 0 or \u0026lt;0, a quarter can be Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, etc\u0026hellip;) and tries every single combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProblem: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale.

You can collapse nodes, focus on one part of the tree, and review logic visually. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, and human errors can still happen, but it makes everything reviewable. You isolate the problem from thousands of JSON lines to a simpler graph, way more manageable, even for non-technical people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I gave it a shot. I set up a Miro project, wrote a script to export their mind maps in a JSON-compatible format using their API, and added some lightweight tests. It was quite fun: I re-created the scenarios as nodes in Miro, ran the script, and the tool was comparing expectation, suggesting missing cases, and even highlight similar-looking logic paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 2060px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 54.1642%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/wvMIEC5f?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked great for a prototype.\nBut once the node count grew, \u003cstrong\u003eMiro became unusable and slow\u003c/strong\u003e, and the experience worsened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest problems is that the search and replace feature hanged, making it unusable (we have dozens of trees, one for each part of the element) and when I had to create a new one there was no smart copy-paste (either grab a whole tree or nothing).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started using several Miro files to be able to open them but this was getting out of hand.

Especially for complex products, the more we proceed with the implementation, the more research and documentation was part of my tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0026rsquo;s how I structured my explanation, in 3 points:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-the-structure\"\u003e1. The Structure\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, this is one slide. I personally hate architecture diagrams unless I already know a bit about the product. Otherwise, they’re often just a flex to show how complex and intricate the product is\u0026hellip; Which is usually true, and I get that developers want to show how hard their job is. But if it’s my first time interacting with the product, complexity doesn’t amaze me. It worries and confuses me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I summarized StoryTeller in 4 boxes and 3 arrows. That’s it.

How to Interact With It\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an API, so the important parts are response times, flexibility, how to query it, and so on.

Oof, 3 hours lost, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t read my own documentation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStories like that can really frustrate an API user, so I made sure to explain the key points to follow and highlight common stress points. As a customer, I find this kind of proactive support incredibly valuable. It saves hours of frustration and nervousness in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eList of stress points you might encounter:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 432px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 66.6667%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/GU6cK6C\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003enote: Marketing asked me to clarify that this is just a Spongebob meme.

The rest of the time was spent answering to multiple questions about technical details, which I found a great sign. People followed with enthusiasm. This approach sparked curiosity and interest, and being easy to follow, we managed to dive deep towards the end, when everyone had already understood the base concepts.

I spent the first month brainstorming lessons and exercises, then worked with my Datacamp contact to make sure everything made sense for the audience. The result was the \u0026ldquo;outline\u0026rdquo;, a document with a description for each item of the course, the list you see in the \u003ca href=\"https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/plan-and-implement-a-data-analytics-environment-with-microsoft-fabric\"\u003eDatacamp portal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding the right balance was tricky.

A solid database design provides the foundation for everything else. Too often, developers adapt their database to fit application logic.

I remember our instructor showing us funny videos of different cultures interacting. There was an American asking an Indian colleague if they\u0026rsquo;ll meet next week\u0026rsquo;s deadline. The response, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e could mean either \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;sure\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;no way\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e depending on the cultural context. Needless to add that the American was very confused when the deadline wasn\u0026rsquo;t met the week after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because India is a high-context culture, where linguistic nuances are the norm. An Indian person won\u0026rsquo;t give us negative feedback directly. Instead, they use varying levels of complex analogies to provide indirect hints on how to improve. Compare this to a low-context Swedish person. He will be more likely to say \u0026ldquo;This system sucks\u0026rdquo; in a blunt and direct way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer on generalizations: It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that we\u0026rsquo;re discussing averages and general tendencies, not stereotypes.

I was able to connect more naturally and avoid many intercultural oopsie.\nKnowing cultures serves as a shortcut: if I\u0026rsquo;m talking with someone from a low-context culture, I can expect some sharp and direct comments.

If it\u0026rsquo;s a list of three bullet points, use the Arc of Silence, read each point, add more context, go to the second point, add second context, and so on. You need to cover everything, and keep all the points simple. Reading every word on the slide is usually a bad sign, but if you do it like this, you will fix everything in the memory of the audience as they have two inputs: voice and visual, saying the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing your slide deck can be challenging: opt for a streamlined presentation and provide a more detailed slide deck as a handout afterward.

The tone of our feedback conversations conveys this message clearly. A common struggle for many professionals is the lack of constructive feedback. Be the person who provides what they need; \u003cstrong\u003ewell-delivered feedback is always appreciated when approached correctly\u003c/strong\u003e.

You are speaking in from of a crowd, but \u003cstrong\u003ethe real audience is only a person\u003c/strong\u003e. You are telling the room the value he has brought there.

Handling Introductions (❓)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntroducing someone to an audience is crucial. You should \u003cstrong\u003eprime them briefly\u003c/strong\u003e because they will be the focus. Be original and personalize the introduction by highlighting 2 or 3 attributes of the speaker that are relevant to the upcoming discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"17-facilitating-brainstorming-meetings\"\u003e17.

Leading Others\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is regarding the next stage of your career, where you lead your people.

But what \u003cstrong\u003eyou absolutely need is a group of followers\u003c/strong\u003e\nWithout other opeople, you only have nothign b ut potential. Leadership is, in the end, the ability to connect with them inspire them, guide them. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not about you. You have to communicate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour values: define them. Whether your statement of values focuses on integrity or courage or street smarts or anything else, you must phrase your values about others. Reframe to the audience\u0026rsquo;s perspective, e.g. \u0026ldquo;I believe in work-life balance\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;you deserve a healthy balance and to see your kids on more than just the weekend\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour vision: broarder than a set of actions, bur more concrete of a vague statement of ideas.

Showing Vulnerability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo lead, we must instill confidence in others, which comes from an inner sense of self-respect and self-awareness. And \u003cstrong\u003epart of this confidens comes from showing your genuine self\u003c/strong\u003e, which may admit to failures, embrace chance, show anxieties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often fear being exposed, but the reality is, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about that—we already are. No one expects us to be perfect, especially not those we work closely with. It\u0026rsquo;s liberating to admit when we\u0026rsquo;re wrong or unsure about something. Another common fear is rejection: however, the more people understand the authentic you, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll see that you\u0026rsquo;re not fundamentally different from them as a whole person.

So, I want to share my notes to help others with similar needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-business-case-an-ai-analyst\"\u003eMy Business Case: an AI Analyst\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with the big question I had in my mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a big, complex data source (a database, an API). How can I connect it to an AI and be fairly* confident it doesn’t mess things up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Remember, with AI, you can’t be 100% sure of anything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I worked with our order database to create an “AI Analyst\u0026quot; using Azure OpenAI. The goal was to enable it to respond to common questions like, \u003cem\u003e“When is my order arriving?”\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e“What’s the order status for this customer?”\u003c/em\u003e This would save our analysts time and effort since the majority of the questions they receive are always the same..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not talking of the toy databases you find in tutorials with 3 tables and 10 columns, this is a real schema with joins, millions of rows and knowledge of the business logic required. The cool part is that by using tools the AI model won’t care about the complexity underneath: as you’ll see, the possibilities are endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-ai-tools\"\u003eBefore AI Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the “old days” (five months ago, lol), the only way was to use GPT-3.5 to make SQL queries and return a response, specifically with Langchain and a \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/use_cases/sql/\"\u003eSQL\u003c/a\u003e plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also considered making DAX queries to \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/powerbi/\"\u003ePower BI\u003c/a\u003e models. However, AI tends to hallucinate when you add a couple of joins in SQL, and it gets even worse with a language that has only a fraction of the documentation and popularity.

Tools allow the latest AI models (3.5 turbo, 4, 4o) to decide whether calling certain functions when needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like telling to our GPT, \u003ccode\u003e“Reply to my {QUESTION}, knowing that if I ask about the weather, you can use this {FUNCTION} which needs the city and time as input.”\u003c/code\u003e.

It’s better to ask the user to provide precise dates or calculate the date within the function.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways check the possible questions that could be asked and tweak the template accordingly.

However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale well with larger datasets, and manual refreshes are necessary for obtaining the freshest data.

The concept is straightforward yet ingenious: one report to serve them all.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works: we import all the data into a report, then publish it in a shared Power BI workspace accessible to users. Daily (and hourly) ETL pipelines handle refreshing the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; report automatically, overseen by data engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this setup, users can \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;live connect\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e to the report and enjoy all the benefits of Import Mode—size, speed, and simplicity—without worrying about refreshing the semantic model, which resides elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a significant drawback is the inability to modify the semantic model directly since it\u0026rsquo;s located elsewhere.

Still, be very cautious with composite models and keep an eye for future updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Composite Model blends a Live Connection (which essentially becomes a DirectQuery) with another DirectQuery or a local file in Import Mode.

Later, typically at the end of my day when tackling a substantial task isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal, I revisit these notes to organize them properly, adding relationships and moving them in the apposite subfolders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother engaging activity involves exploring the note tree. I enjoy clicking through the dots and uncovering unconnected notes (\u0026ldquo;orphans\u0026rdquo;), re-reading them, and establishing fresh connections or cleaning up outdated entries. This process breathes life into many forgotten notes and ensures my vault remains tidy and updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent some time on saving scripts and code snippets I started using frequently, to have a centralized repository (more like a toolbox) of codes at my disposal when needed.

Since the Obsidian vault is just an extensive markdown repository, I\u0026rsquo;ve considered automation possibilities such as generating notes automatically when we receive new tickets, complete with metadata. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on an experimental script to extract text using OCR from PowerPoint and Word files, transforming them into Markdown format through the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Unstructured-IO\"\u003eUnstructured\u003c/a\u003e Python library. This way, content within slides or images becomes searchable in Obsidian and it\u0026rsquo;s very helpful as I had several slide decks to ingest. I will share more details on these automations in future if I reach an alpha stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also introduced a \u0026ldquo;Today I Learned\u0026rdquo; note, where I collect bite-sized pieces of knowledge, such as a SQL trick or intriguing facts.

While it offers great potential as I can embed notes in the charts, it\u0026rsquo;s still somewhat limited compared to other diagramming tools, lacking features like custom icons or shapes.

For instance, I\u0026rsquo;ve created a meeting template with fields for attendees, an automatic date property, goals, and notes.

Neglecting this aspect can result in a chaotic collection of unfinished notes that are hard to locate. Effective titling is key, and I\u0026rsquo;ve often found myself renaming generic notes to capture their essence more precisely to avoid losing them (e.g. \u003ccode\u003eticket for adding new business logic to table\u003c/code\u003e → \u003ccode\u003eRegion South-East Logic update in DB.REGION_TABLE\u003c/code\u003e).

Consequently, Meta\u0026rsquo;s social media platform decided to temporarily remove the option of adding music to posts. This was a significant concern for my blog since we frequently used this feature, allowing readers to listen to the music while reading the article on our homepage. Additionally, Instagram heavily emphasizes videos, following the success of TikTok, resulting in a continuous decline in reach for our static posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s when the idea struck me: \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003ewe should transition to video reviews.\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial media isn\u0026rsquo;t the primary focus of our blog, and I use it sparingly.

I also wanted to acquire video editing skills that could prove useful for future projects. Additionally, since we\u0026rsquo;re on the topic, I thought it would be beneficial to explore the chaotic realm of TikTok, considering it\u0026rsquo;s the direction in which social media is evolving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-the-starting-point-redditvideomakerbot\"\u003e🏠 The starting point: RedditVideoMakerBot\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy idea was to download generic abstract video backgrounds, add the sound of the reviewed song using Python and FFMPEG, and manually insert the article text with the TikTok app before uploading.

I am impressed by all the features that the developers have rolled out recently, greatly improving both user and creator experiences. However, one should always maintain an impartial critical vision of the tools, no matter how useful they can be. For this reason, I decided to share my thoughts about some features that are currently lacking or require over-complicated solutions (often from third-party tools), in the hope that Microsoft will find them useful when working on Power BI\u0026rsquo;s development roadmap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile writing, I found myself lucky as all the points I\u0026rsquo;ll state are currently edge cases or issues I\u0026rsquo;ve solved with other solutions.

Thus, organizing my information, tasks, and notes is a key activity in my work (and personal) life. Without a clear system, I would feel lost in chaos, and my productivity would plunge (also considering that my memory sucks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I want to introduce you to two buzzwords related to the note taking: \u003cstrong\u003eBrain Dumping\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSecond Brain\u003c/strong\u003e. Brain Dumping is a technique that involves storing as quick as possible any useful data in a safe place, so it can be easily accessed and cleaned later and the brain can avoid worrying about them. For example, if you have a code snippet that helped you solve a problem, you can copy and paste it into a note in your \u0026ldquo;_TO_ORGANIZE\u0026rdquo; folder.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m free, usually at the end of the day, I cleanse the note, add some context to the code, and put them in the right section of my documentation tool. Some old-schoolers use post-it notes and agendas, I use Second Brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we\u0026rsquo;ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.\n\u0026ndash; \u003ccite\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/\"\u003eTiago Forte \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept has given rise to tools like which are strucuted to help take note-taking to the next level.\nThese tools, structured like wikis, extend the concept of Brain Dumping by making taking notes, connecting and structuring them a bliss, or in my special case, even a \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; activity. The biggest players are \u003ca href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\"\u003eRoam Research\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e, all with different characteristics but sharing the same core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I love using Notion for my personal Second Brain because of its user-friendly UX. You may already know my deep love for Notion , which I use on my daily life and I contribute to the Python library. For starters, I recommend it thanks to its user-friendly UX, and it\u0026rsquo;s the go-to choice for my personal Second Brain. Sometimes I give access to part of my Notion wiki to other people and they immediately catch up with its structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for work, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that Obsidian is the way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/notes.png\" alt=\"notes\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-at-work\"\u003e💼 Obsidian at work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Notion stores data on their servers without a self-hosted option and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work offline, so putting sensitive data in there is out of question. Obsidian, differently, works completely offline (so unless you pay for a Premium service or use a shared directory you can\u0026rsquo;t access its notes from other devices). Its notes are \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; Markdown files (a special textual format with a specific syntax for basic customization) stored in the PC, just like .txt documents\u0026hellip; And the program reads them like Notepad, super minimal and lightweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Obsidian notes have a singular characteristic that makes them particularly suitable in my current environment\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are like neurons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put it plainly, Obsidian is literally a second brain. Notes don\u0026rsquo;t have to be structured in a folder and can be interconnected with hyperlinks, which creates an out-of-world experience for exploring and finding new relationships. And all it takes is mentioning the other file between brackets! A picture is worth a thousand words, and here is a typical Obsidian graph view that allows you to visually explore how notes are linked to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/obsidian_graph.png\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_search.gif\" alt=\"graph view 2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-why-i-have-chosen-obsidian\"\u003e☝ Why I have chosen Obsidian\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy job is a constant juggling act of multiple large projects, meetings, tickets, and reports from various data sources. It\u0026rsquo;s a labyrinth of information that\u0026rsquo;s impossible to navigate without getting lost. But then, Obsidian comes to the rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its ability to link notes together, I can map out the entire flow of information and stay on top of everything. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I do it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach meeting is linked to the relevant projects or open tickets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach ticket is linked to the reports and data sources notes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach data source is linked to its business logics and other data sources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach project has documentation and links to all related meetings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach script is linked to the ticket or project it\u0026rsquo;s been useful for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so on, depending on the scenario.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s graph view, I can quickly access all the information connected to a single object. During meetings or whenever I gain new intel, I quickly jot it down using the \u0026ldquo;Brain Dumping\u0026rdquo; strategy and store it in Obsidian. Later, I organize the notes, link them together, and expand the wiki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-a-brief-overview-of-the-structure\"\u003e📁 A brief overview of the structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Obsidian vault is a treasure trove of information that I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to structure in a way that is easy for my colleagues to access. It\u0026rsquo;s a semi-structured schema with high flexiblity as it\u0026rsquo;s not required by Obsidian (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a sort option) that helps to organize the wealth of information that I need to manage every day. With main folders and subfolders, I can easily navigate my way around and find what I need quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a snapshot of my Obsidian vault structure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTO_ORGANIZE\u003c/strong\u003e - this is where I store new notes by default before cleaning them up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDocs\u003c/strong\u003e - where I keep all the important documentation that my team and I need to access quickly.

These folders usually contain other subfolders with additional information.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTickets\u003c/strong\u003e - a comprehensive list of open and closed tickets, divided by department.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeetings\u003c/strong\u003e - notes from all the meetings I attend, divided by department.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal\u003c/strong\u003e - a space for me to keep personal notes and scripts, divided by language and context.

It\u0026rsquo;s a system that is not only efficient but also visually appealing. I could remove all the folders if I wanted to, but the structure helps to give a familiar feel to other users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-plugins-i-use\"\u003e🔨 Plugins I use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a plethora of options available in the marketplace to enhance the Obsidian experience. While I prefer to keep things streamlined, here are a few plugins that I can wholeheartedly recommend:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003eEditor Syntax Highlight\u003c/a\u003e: exceedingly helpful, especially when dealing with notes containing code snippets. It makes syntax highlighting a breeze, and makes the code much more readable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table\"\u003eExcel to Markdown table\u003c/a\u003e: an absolute lifesaver when you need to copy data from Excel files. It takes care of all the formatting issues, saving you a ton of time and effort.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder\"\u003eIcon Folder\u003c/a\u003e: I love this plugin because it allows me to maintain the same aesthetic I was accustomed to in Notion, where every folder had a corresponding emoji. It\u0026rsquo;s a small touch, but it makes the interface much more enjoyable to use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename\"\u003ePaste Image rename\u003c/a\u003e: If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who frequently pastes screenshots or other images into your notes, then it is an absolute must-have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\"\u003ePaste URL into selection\u003c/a\u003e: another one that replicates the functionality of Notion, and it\u0026rsquo;s a time-saver for me. It allows me to quickly paste a URL into a selected piece of text in my notes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography\"\u003eSmart Typography\u003c/a\u003e: this plugin is all about the aesthetics, and it\u0026rsquo;s a small thing that makes a big difference. It makes minor typographic tweaks (like replacing hyphens with en-dashes), which makes the notes more visually appealing and easier to read.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jdbrice/obsidian-code-block-copy\"\u003eCopy Button for code blocks\u003c/a\u003e: a tiny addition that saves me a ton of time. It adds a copy button to code blocks, so you can quickly copy the code without having to highlight it and use the keyboard shortcut. I can\u0026rsquo;t understand why this functionality isn\u0026rsquo;t already built into Obsidian.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-limitations\"\u003e⛔ Obsidian limitations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, there are some limitations with Obsidian that are impacting my experience. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnfortunately, there is no option to share a note as a public link that can be accessed by others (web or within my organization). While I understand Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s focus on privacy and \u0026ldquo;private notes,\u0026rdquo; I do miss the convenience of being able to easily share a page as a link with a colleague or leave clickable shortcuts to links in a folder like in Notion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe PDF export feature is limited, and there\u0026rsquo;s no way to export notes in bulk. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;d like to automatically upload a PDF of some notes in a folder when I edit them with specific formatting. But unless I start learning \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template\"\u003eLaTeX and pandoc\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m unable to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyntax formatting in code blocks isn\u0026rsquo;t enabled unless you have \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003ean outdated plugin\u003c/a\u003e that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even support DAX (Power BI\u0026rsquo;s script language) formatting. While I\u0026rsquo;m working on a plugin fork to address this issue, it\u0026rsquo;s a tedious process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile the Obsidian team is currently focused on the \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/canvas\"\u003eCanvas feature\u003c/a\u003e, which is a fantastic addition for those who previously used Graph.io and similar software, the frequency and impact of updates are slow due to the team\u0026rsquo;s small size. Thus, I doubt that my previous issues will be addressed quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, I would strongly advise against using Obsidian if you are not fond of its neural structure, especially if your notes are not often interconnected. This is due to the fact that the learning curve can be steep, requiring the mastery of several shortcuts and a certain discipline in maintaining notes. If you neglect to organize your vault, it can quickly become overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that if you\u0026rsquo;re not utilizing connections, you\u0026rsquo;re only tapping into half of Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-first-results\"\u003e🥳 First Results\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been four months since I started using Obsidian, and it has already been a game-changer for me on multiple occasions. Initially, I was skeptical due to my love for Notion, but the adoption process was seamless, and my productivity has definitively increased. The most incredible thing about Obsidian is how I can instantly look back at past meetings connected to a particular topic and explore further, find connections, and expand my knowledge by examining other notes and reconstructing the entire scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn excellent example that I presented in my proposal was a story about a user who raised a question during a brief meeting about an advanced Power BI feature. During the meeting, I took some notes on the issue, then created another note with a guide, and then another note about the following meeting where I introduced the guide. A few days later, I completely forgot where the guide was located, but I remembered the user\u0026rsquo;s happy reaction in the second-grade related note and traced my way back to the valuable document. I use this technique multiple times a day when searching for notes, and it saves me a lot of time piece by piece. Also, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about restructuring notes when a project evolves; I can just link them together and embed updates of the project in a primary super note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_view.gif\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most significant advantage, as mentioned in the introduction, is the ease of the \u0026ldquo;brain dumping\u0026rdquo; process. Whenever I come across new information, I can open Obsidian in one second, create a note with a shortcut, and jot down a few lines to be cleaned up later. My brain is now free to keep listening and learning without worrying about forgetting anything valuable. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a huge boost to my personal sanity and productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, I also have a few scripts that automate the process of cleaning links and organizing notes in my vault, as they are just a bunch of .md textual files in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this innovative way of organizing notes, then I recommend giving Obsidian a try. There are tools available for importing notes from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dmuth/evernote-to-obsidian\"\u003eEvernote\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Segza/OneNote-to-Obsidian\"\u003eOneNote\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/connertennery/Notion-to-Obsidian-Converter\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, so the transition is seamless.

This is a very complex strategy as you need to be extremely prepared to the different scenarios and create additional material\u0026hellip; It works well in case of a presentation you need to share several times with groups with different knowledge levels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📻 \u003cstrong\u003eAnalog Noise\u003c/strong\u003e\nPlace unpolished elements in the presentation to make a key message stand out (e.g. an ugly font for the title of a slide introducing a problem).

Difficult to explain without examples, the concept is that by making elements move (e.g. “As Is” → animation that kicks it out of the screen → “To Be” fades in) you can tell an animated story, super effective. Personally, I don’t like animations but the pattern can be useful for simple, key concepts. Use it sparsely, the book relies too much on that. Use soft transitions (dissolve, push) to shift delicately from slide to slide.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👻 \u003cstrong\u003eInvisibility\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn case of an audience that has already read the presentation and knows what you are going to talk about. Add an animation that begins with a blank page (and everyone will be focused on what you are talking about as they can’t be distracted), and then show the content. They can’t expect it in the printout: it will be a surprising moment, but in my opinion it’s too showy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👄 \u003cstrong\u003eLipsync\u003c/strong\u003e\n(For Live Demos). Playing live with the tool can be risky, as there are numerous unpredictable issues that can happen. Record yourself before the talk when using the tool and play the video while talking over it or in case of emergency. You can be less stressed, you can skip boring or lengthy moments, you can highlight certain parts. However, you can’t improvise if the audience asks you anything. Suggestion: hide Windows Tray and another unnecessary parts of the screen, as they will distract audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📼 \u003cstrong\u003eLive on Tape\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf travelling issues occur, video-record your presentation like you were live in that same room: this makes the video more natural and engaging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"deliver\"\u003eDeliver\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛹️‍♀️ \u003cstrong\u003ePreparation\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlways be ready for the worst-case scenario.

Even one friendly face can make the difference, so introducing yourself to strangers and making some good impressions can help. It is also convenient to build connection with other people with the same interests and maybe make the expectations they have about you very clear.

Use this concept at your advantage, show that you are prepared and comfortable with the situation. Don’t apologize for technical issues, but move on and keep talking. Don’t let other people (Hecklers) hijack your presentation. Don’t look confused when you can’t reply to a question, suggest ways to follow up later instead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔁 \u003cstrong\u003eCarnegie Hall\u003c/strong\u003e\nPractice. Practice.Practice. Present it to your pets first, then to a friendly crowd (friends, colleagues), record yourself if you want to.

Embrace silences. When stressed, you tend to speak faster, to fill up every gap and constantly be active, which reveals your nervousness. Plan some tactical breaks during (and before) key moments, pay attention to the rhythm of your voice. Sometimes the author writes a symbol in the notes to remember to breathe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🦶 \u003cstrong\u003eShoeless\u003c/strong\u003e\nAchieve relax with little quirks to help ignoring the stress. Removing shoes may be a bit odd in corporate environments, but the pattern can be extended to everything that makes you more comfortable.

You have to be the mentor of the audience, their guide to a new world they don’t know. They need to feel that you care about it and leave the event enlightened with your wisdom. Preparing a strong Narrative Arc does help.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌧 \u003cstrong\u003eWeatherman\u003c/strong\u003e\nFace the camera like a Weatherman on the news, don’t look at the screen behind you but speak directly to your audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍒 \u003cstrong\u003eSeeding the First Question\u003c/strong\u003e\nUsually the audience is embarrassed to ask the first question, you need to find a way to break the ice. A good idea is to serve an obvious question in your presentation.

Don’t overuse it (leave the joke out if in doubt) or there is high risk of alienating the public; also, it should be relevant to your Narrative Arc and pay attention to not offend anyone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🕶 \u003cstrong\u003eThe Stakeout\u003c/strong\u003e\nALWAYS go to the talk earlier to avoid last-minute issues, get familiar with the environment, and, if possible, start chatting with the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔦 \u003cstrong\u003eLightsaber\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse the laser pointer judiciously like a skilled Jedi, highlighting the point of the slide you want to focus on when necessary.

It sometimes happens with Required presentation, too simple/technical topics (lack of knowledge of the audience) or due date if you made it very quickly.\nThe result of a celery presentation is “well, that’s an hour of my life I’ll never get back”.\n✔ → Know your audience and stick to your story and present a compelling Narrative Arc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"build-1\"\u003eBuild\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍪 \u003cstrong\u003eCookie Cutter\u003c/strong\u003e\nPutting too much content in a single slide will saturate your presentation and have a negative effect to the audience.

Don’t be afraid to be silent for a second.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔇 \u003cstrong\u003eDisowning Your Topic\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t change your presentation on the fly because you think your audience is not interested.\n✔ → Be prepared and Know Your Audience and this antipattern won’t occur. Remember that social hints may be misleading, and that you can’t please everyone. Just stick to what you have planned to minimize risk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐖 \u003cstrong\u003eLipstick on a Pig\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you try to fix a bad presentation by to making it more aesthetically appealing. The slides are initially good, but your talk doesn’t leave any result in the long run.\n✔ → The authors recommend to set up a solid base before adding lipstick, suggesting “\u003cem\u003eone hour of preparation for every minute of presentation\u003c/em\u003e” (a bit too much in my case 😄). Time is the key, and all the previous pattern about having a clear and meaningful structure in mind.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🗼 \u003cstrong\u003eTower of Babble\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse technical jargon can be effective with the right audience, but can backfire, especially if you are doing it for flaunting your intellect. Difficult to notice if you talk “IT” every day.\n✔ → Know your audience and understand when and how much you can be more technical. For a business audience, stick to a simpler and more practical wording.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e☢ \u003cstrong\u003eBunker\u003c/strong\u003e\nMetaphorically ”hiding” behind the podium or showing distance from the audience, which is a natural behavior if one’s stressed.\n✔ → Know your audience and practice with your talk to achieve confidence, pay attention to your body language.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📣 \u003cstrong\u003eHecklers\u003c/strong\u003e\nThat kind of guest who monopolize your talk by continuously asking (often tricky) questions, making you lose time and patience. The agenda is at risk with heckers!\n✔ → Don’t be afraid to be the bad guy! Your scope is to protect your audience from time sinks. Don’t fell for the traps, but tell the heckler to follow up after the talk and remind him that you have a lot more to talk about. Deal decisively (eye contact, short sentences, firm tone).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎎 \u003cstrong\u003eGo Meta\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t talk about the talk, boooooring (e.g. technical issues you had before starting or anecdotes about the preparation).\n✔ → You already have limited time: focus on your Narrative Arc!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBackchannel\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt’s basically people tweeting or chatting with other people about the talk while you are speaking, which can bring distress and present a challenge. It’s not an antipattern, just a more complicate scenario because you may have to handle criticism in real time.\n✔ → Think about that when preparing the slides: can your message be condensed in a tweet? What’s the central point? Don’t be afraid to reply to questions and criticism during the event.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⚔ \u003cstrong\u003eLaser Weapons\u003c/strong\u003e\nLaser pointers can be effective for highlighting sections in dense slides, but they may be difficult to see for users in the back and are temporary: when you turn off the laser, the attention is gone.\n✔ → Better to use the Traveling Highlights and highlight directly in the slide\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🙋‍♂️ \u003cstrong\u003eNegative Ignorance\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you ask things like “Who’s not familiar with the XXX concept?” to better understand the level of the audience, it’s very likely that nobody will tell you the truth as they don’t want to feel stupid. Having incorrect feedbacks may bomb the presentation as you could act as too technical.\n✔ → Don’t ask these questions but be prepared (and, of course, Know Your Audience to avoid doubts). Keep in mind that part of the audience will know too much, part has no idea about the topic and the majority is in the middle. Prepare a 30-60 seconds summary of the advanced concept you want to introduce to keep as many people as possible engaged and informed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👾 \u003cstrong\u003eDual-Headed Monster\u003c/strong\u003e\nThis point is about the technical issues that can happen in case of an hybrid/online talk, which is not a real antipattern, just a slightly more difficult scenario. Outdated, as every presentation I make is online.\n✔ → Check the equipment, including the connection speed, and avoid Going Meta when an things break.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-others-presentations-slides\"\u003e❓ Others (presentations, slides)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"prepare-2\"\u003ePrepare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e😩 \u003cstrong\u003eRequired \u0026amp; Proposed (also Invited) Presentations\u003c/strong\u003e\nRequired → You have to speak (usually a difficult situation, yet it can become a low-risk opportunity to impress management and audience)\nProposed → You send an application for speaking at a conference, usually you are interested in the topic.\nInvited → You are so famous that conferences are asking you to speak there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔨 \u003cstrong\u003eExpansion Joints\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a clever trick to keep some slides that can be either skippable or a source for digression in case of time issues. Difficult to implement, they are a safety net if you have a fixed time slot to fulfill.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐣 \u003cstrong\u003eTalklet\u003c/strong\u003e\nA talklet is a presentation inside another presentation, to be used for a little digression with its own Narrative Arc. Psychological research shows that the average adult attention span is about 20 minutes. It is a good idea to split each Arc into that time frame, while the main Arc acts as a container for the entire talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👁 \u003cstrong\u003eUnifying Visual Theme\u003c/strong\u003e\nA visual theme provides benefits as it is easier to connect visual elements to the topics you are presenting. Be creative, don’t use the default clip art and images, but at the same time don’t bend your presentation to match a theme. It’s nice to use metaphors and include them as images in the presentations. E.g. a plan sprouting from soil is a theme picked by Neal Ford in its emerging tech talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛈ \u003cstrong\u003eLightning Talk\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a kind of presentation with fixed time limit, short in duration. It is difficult to create a meaningful story with limited material as it requires extensive preparation and there is no time for mistakes\u0026hellip; However it is a great occasion for being creative. You can cheat by using multiple slides with the same image and no transitions, which counts as 1 slide. \u003ca href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home\"\u003eIgnite conferences\u003c/a\u003e are an example of Lightning Talks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔫 \u003cstrong\u003eTakahashi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlso known as Lessig, it is a style of presentation with minimal imagery/verbiage and super fast transitions. Unlikely to be used with technical talks unless you want to insert a break in between, but very effective when delivering keynotes. You only need a lot of slides with one element each! Check \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s\"\u003ethis example\u003c/a\u003e by Jack Rusher at Strange Loop 2022.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🖌 \u003cstrong\u003eCave Painting\u003c/strong\u003e\nAn innovative layout that uses a huge sectioned canvas where you can zoom in and out with each slide instead of the classic transition.

It is not meant to be presented, but rather consumed by a single person. Here you can include diagrams, (SHORT) bullet points, few words and work with a spatial layout. Pay attention to not transform it into a Slideument and create it knowing that you won’t likely have to present it → no animations, no big images, no Brain Breaks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🚢 \u003cstrong\u003eVacation Photos\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides with only full-screen images and very few (if no) words: extremely effective with storytelling, less in technical presentations, but keep it in mind as it is a key concept of the book. Users need to have an image in their minds, otherwise they will spend time and attention creating their own. Don’t distract them with too flashy images.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧯 \u003cstrong\u003eCharred Trail\u003c/strong\u003e\nA kind of slide specifically made to fix the issues with Slideuments and Bullet-Riddled Corpses. It’s an animated bullet point list where each point is appears one at a time and then grays out to keep the audience focused on the last element. The “printed” outcome will be like a classic bulleted slide, which is OK for documents, but while presenting you can make sure that the users won’t read all the bullets instead of listening. It requires a bit of tweaking with PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎩 \u003cstrong\u003eExuberant Title Top\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide type strictly related to the Charred Trail pattern (also in this case the printout will be Infodeck-friendly). The heading begins in the center of the slide and the hovers at the top while the body appear. Used to center the attention on the title, especially when it’s a bold assertion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📑 \u003cstrong\u003eContext Keeper\u003c/strong\u003e\nSimilar to Breadcrumbs but at a slide level: you can keep the same element (e.g. an image or a title) between slides while the rest changes to reveal the structure of the topic you are introducing. Suggestion: use the Morph animation in PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍞 \u003cstrong\u003eBreadcrumbs\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is easy to lose track of the agenda if the presentation is long. A breadcrumb is a slide that can be added while transitioning between the points of the agenda to remind the audience what’s the general plan and at what point of the presentation we are. It can be a copy of the agenda slide with the current bullet highlighted in bold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📚 \u003cstrong\u003eBookends (and Preroll and Crawling Credits)\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides at the beginning and at the end of the presentation with your name and contacts. Useless in my current case, but it can reassure the audience that they are in the correct room, introduce yourself and, when concluding, they can contain other URLs, for example for downloading the slides or asking for feedbacks.\nPreroll is an automatic carousel of slides to play before the beginning two or three slides with information so you can save time and attention resources.\nCrawling Credits is the opposite: an animation in Star-Wars style of the Coda at the end. Cool yet nothing special to me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎬 \u003cstrong\u003eIntermezzi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlternative to Breadcrumbs. While changing each logical part of the presentation, add a slide to introduce the new concept. We have it in our template, OK.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBacktracking\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide to bring the attention back to another slide you have shown in the past. This element is used in case of a little digression where you open a Talklet and want to come back to the original agenda. Suggestion: use a distinctive “back” transition to close the digression.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎦 \u003cstrong\u003eLive Demo\u003c/strong\u003e\nA special kind of presentation where you don’t need many slides, but you mostly use and present a tool. It can be the right way if you are talking about the tool and the audience is expected to mimic you and learn.\nIt is particuarly difficult to make a good Live Demo! Practice a lot, practice how to talk while using the tool to keep the audience interested, and expect to make mistakes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e✈ \u003cstrong\u003eTraveling Highlights (and Crawling Code)\u003c/strong\u003e\nFor slides with source code or huge amount of information, highlight the section you are talking about with a subtle window animation.\nCrawling Code adds boxed or highlights to the part of code mentioned, hiding all the rest to avoid distractions (e.g. \u003ca href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/encryption-boot-camp-on-the-jvm\"\u003eSlide 24 of Encryption Boot Camp on the JVM\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔔 \u003cstrong\u003eEmergence\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you want to reveal the key slide of your presentation, which requires a buildup first, slowly build hype with subtle animations to initially obscure part of the slide and then suddenly reveal the content, piece by piece.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/presentation_patterns_cover.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/01/personal-notes-about-presentation-patterns/","title":"Personal Notes about Presentation Patterns"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThere is something bizarre with me if two of my favourite activities are writing documentation and hitting my head against tests, which are notoriously unexciting activities for many developers 😫\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, we are all unique in our own way and I decided to contribute to \u003ca href=\"https://codecov.io/github/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003ethe testing module\u003c/a\u003e of one of my favorite libraries, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003enotion-sdk-py\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing \u003ca href=\"https://www.credly.com/badges/f15407b3-5fa8-4d9b-99cf-d862399a1543/public_url\"\u003ea certified Notion user\u003c/a\u003e, I use its Web App on a daily basis, and the Python library helps me automatically organize my notes.

This is a \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators\"\u003egenerator\u003c/a\u003e, a function that returns a lazy iterator which doesn’t store its content in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this method, there will be a final step for cleaning up everything and resetting the environment even in case of a failure.

E.g. \u003ccode\u003eColours = {”Red”, “White”, “Blue”}\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ccode\u003eAnimals = {(”Dog”, “Woof”),( “Cat”, “Meow”)}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"calculated-columns\"\u003eCalculated Columns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten as \u003ccode\u003e‘Table Name’[Column Name]\u003c/code\u003e, calculated columns are new columns added to the data model, and you can use them just like a default one, independently from the context. Just be aware that in Import Mode (the standard one), they are calculated during the data refresh, then stored in memory, occupying some precious RAM! If you have a complex formula, don’t break it down into intermediate steps as you do in Excel, but rather create and test it in DAX Studio and store the result in a single calculated column to optimize the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should use a calculated column if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe result will be in a slicer, matrix, pivot, or \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e condition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have an expression that is relative to the single row and doesn’t require aggregation, like \u003ccode\u003ePrice * Quantity\u003c/code\u003e which must use the Price of the row and the Quantity of the row\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have to categorize text or numbers, e.g. assigning a High, Medium, Low range, or 0-18, 18-25, 25+.

Generally, you should use them when you don’t want to calculate values for each row, but you want an aggregation: in fact, a measure has an implicit CALCULATE clause in its formula and is modified by the context (see Chapter 5). Here’s a good example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you create a calculated column like \u003ccode\u003eSales[GrossMarginPct] = Sales[GrossMargin] / Sales[SalesAmount]\u003c/code\u003e, you will see that the total is more than 100% (If our ten products have a 50% Gross Margin each, the table displays 50*10 → 500%)! DAX is applying the formula row-by-row, but we want to see the total instead.

It returns a list of unique values, requiring a table or a list of columns, not an expression; if you use \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e with more than a column, it will give back all the possible unique combinations existing in the table. \u003ccode\u003eALLEXCEPT\u003c/code\u003e can be translated as ‘take everything from that table except the following columns’. The rest will be explained in Chapter 14.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"valuesdistinctblank\"\u003eVALUES,DISTINCT,BLANK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e return a list of unique values too… With a big difference. \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e returns the visible values, so it’s not ignoring the active filters, and the same does \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e. They are different in the case of invalid relations. There’s a great example in the chapter: if, for example, a product is missing from the Product table, the join between it and the Sales table will have blank rows in the results. In this case, \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e gets confused when calculating the average amount for product, while \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e considers the blank row correctly in the division.

If you understand context, you will avoid the most common errors when you code in DAX.

A context is, in short, the environment where the expression is evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filter-context\"\u003eFilter Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not able to explain it as well as in the book without examples, but here’s my personal interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a table with a measure, say \u003ccode\u003eTotalSales = SUMX(Sales[Amount]\u003c/code\u003e. A table has rows and cells. Every expression is evaluated based on its cell, which in turn is modified based on active filters and the selected column. So, the TotalSales measure will be, say, 30Mln if I put it into a card with no filters and just a cell, but if I use it in a table with multiple rows the is split based on the row’s contents (imagine a division by Area: Europe, US, Asia → 30mln will become 10mln x 3 cells. Behind the scenes, DAX is adding a \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e saying \u003ccode\u003eFILTER (Area = ‘Europe’)\u003c/code\u003e and so on, for every cell). So, the filter context changes the outcome of the expression considering the filters that become active if, for example, it’s inside a specific cell of a table. What’s important is the context of the cell containing it: which is precisely the filter context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"row-context\"\u003eRow Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe example I recommend to read carefully uses this calculated column \u003ccode\u003eSales[Gross Margin] = Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e. Now remember, this column reasons in terms of rows, so, how does DAX manages to understand which row is working on? Using row context, which is basically a cursor. Row context, then, calculates the expression by considering the row that contains it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you write Gross Margin as a measure, you lose the row context, thus you need the iterative version ending with X: \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) )\u003c/code\u003e . The iterative version works because it uses SUMX, capable of keeping the row context. \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e is invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-notes\"\u003eOther Notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… The chapter goes on with several interesting examples and questions for understanding the contexts, especially when used in filters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of complex functions that work in two different contexts, there’s the \u003ccode\u003eEARLIER\u003c/code\u003e function for accessing the more external layer. Honestly, I hope to never use it, it’s extremely tricky, read the book to understand how the switch works, but even the authors admit that variables work better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden rule: \u003cstrong\u003erow context iterates, filter context filters\u003c/strong\u003e. Thus you can’t use the row context without a \u003ccode\u003eRELATED/RELATEDTABLE\u003c/code\u003e. On the contrary, the filter context uses relationships automatically, but be aware that its behavior can be different depending on the relationship’s direction (see chapter 15). I point out a very interesting example with \u003ccode\u003eSUMMARIZE\u003c/code\u003e in the case of the calculation of the average customers’ age without including duplicates: the code shows how to include a different column, read it carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-sql\" data-lang=\"sql\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCorrect Average :\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e AVERAGEX ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- Iterate on\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSUMMARIZE ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- all the existing combinations\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales, \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- that exist in Sales\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[CustomerKey], \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- of the customer key and\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- the customer age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t), \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e--\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- and average the customer\u0026#39;s age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e) \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- TODO: you should break it down in a variable and use AVERAGEX too\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠️ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCALCULATE\u003c/code\u003e is the most important and powerful DAX function and the one with significant nuances to understand. \u003ccode\u003eCALCULATETABLE\u003c/code\u003e is the same but returns a table.

Again, see the example, sometimes this strategy can be slow, but it\u0026rsquo;s easily scalable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReducing the use of CallbackDataID: this is very nice; you can replace \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ROUND(Sales[Net Price],0))\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(VALUES(Sales[Net Price], CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]) * ROUND(Sales[Net Price]0)\u003c/code\u003e and the engine will store part of the query in memory, speeding up future operations!

I could give it a chance, it has good reviews for beginners. A surprising book. Extremely well written, with a story about Dan Harris\u0026rsquo; evolution, who has a very stressful and competitive job, and over the years he felt increasingly stressed and disliked by people. Starting from a few philosophy books he happened to read, he got interested, at first completely skeptical, but he kept going. He ended up in Buddhism, started meditating, even just 5 minutes a day, and it changed his life. Fantastic story, very realistic because he also calls the spiritual elements a bunch of nonsense, and he\u0026rsquo;s super practical! And on top of that it\u0026rsquo;s seasoned with his life as a journalist, full of insights and adventures. Like with the book by the consultant of How to Make Things Faster, the mix of personal stories and practical concepts works!

[\u0026hellip;] Communion with a single body here and now makes you feel connected with the entire cosmos. In truth, your beloved is just another human being, no different from all those you ignore every day on the train or at the supermarket. Yet to you, he or she seems infinite, and you are happy to lose yourself in that infinity.

The author distanced himself from it a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a stark book about how manipulation works. Like Cialdini\u0026rsquo;s and maybe Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, it draws fierce criticism, and people often blame the messenger.

And this is a sharp knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the book is off-putting. It reads as if it assumes that everyone around us is plotting, so you must strike from behind, lie, and generally be unpleasant to get ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you realize it is sadly like this in many environments. This is not a rulebook to follow (absolutely not), but more a collection of warrior and strategist behaviors we should know, so we do not get taken advantage of. So there is something sensible buried in this hefty book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read it quickly because it is long, and Greene adds four, five, six anecdotes for each rule, almost always with some Roman/Chinese/French general and some trick.

Typically, people are working extremely\nhard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your\nusers are vocally dissatisfied.\nA team is treading water if they\u0026rsquo;re able to get their critical work\ndone, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or\nbegin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are\nstill working hard, and your users may seem happier because\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve learned that asking for help won\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere.\nA team is repaying debt when they\u0026rsquo;re able to start paying down\ntechnical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt\nrepayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more\ntime to repay more debt.\n2.2.2\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably\nlow, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user\nneeds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer.

Go somewhere that\u0026rsquo;s\ndisproportionately valuable to you because of who you are and\nwhat you want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the one thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found at companies with very few\ninterruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really\ngreat, consistently available documentation. It\u0026rsquo;s probably even\nharder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting\ncompany than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing\ncompany, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I\u0026rsquo;ve seen\nis a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a\ndocumentation search that actually works.\nThere are a non-zero number of companies that do internal\ndocumentation well, but I\u0026rsquo;m less sure if there are a non-zero\nnumber of companies with more than 20 engineers that do this\nwell. If you know any, please let me know so that I can pick their\nbrains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour first reaction might be to confront this head-on, but it takes\na while to build credibility after starting a new job. Sure, you\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen hired for your experience, so they respect your judgment,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s a hard sell to convince someone that your personal\nexperience should invalidate their personal experience.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying something different.\nModel. Start measuring your team\u0026rsquo;s health (maybe using short,\nmonthly surveys) and your team\u0026rsquo;s throughput (do some\nlightweight form of task sizing, even if you just do it informally\nwith a senior engineer on the team or with yourself), which will\nallow you to establish the baseline before your change.\nThen just start running kanban. Don\u0026rsquo;t publicize it, don\u0026rsquo;t make a\nbig deal about it, just start doing it with your team. Frame it as a\nshort experiment with the team, and start trying it. Keep iterating\non it until you\u0026rsquo;re confident it works. Have the courage to keep at it\nfor a while, and also the courage to stop doing it if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\nafter a month or two. Use the team\u0026rsquo;s health and throughput\nmetrics to ground your decision about whether it\u0026rsquo;s working.\nDocument. After you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered an effective approach,\ndocument the problem you set out to solve, the learning process\nyou went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. Be as detailed as possible:\nmake a canonical document, and even get a few folks on other\nteams to check that it\u0026rsquo;s readable from their perspective.\nShare. The final step is to share your documented approach,\nalong with your experience doing the rollout, in a short email.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t ask everyone to adopt the practice, don\u0026rsquo;t lobby for change,\njust present the approach and your experience following it.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that\nwork effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting\nhow you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to\nchange their approach.\nStrangely, in my experience, this has often led to more adoption\nthan top-down mandates have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few years to glean a lesson from that experience, but\nit comes to mind frequently now when I work with folks who are\njust starting to present to executives. Giving a presentation to\nsenior leadership is a bit of a dark art: it takes a while to master,\nand most people who do it well can\u0026rsquo;t quite articulate how they do\nit. Worse yet, many people who are excellent rely on advantages\nthat resist replication: charisma, quick wit, deep subject matter\nexpertise, or years of experience. Start with the conclusion. Particularly in written\ncommunication, folks skim until they get bored and then stop\nreading. Accommodate this behavior by starting with what\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant, instead of building toward it gradually.\nFrame why the topic matters. Typically, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting on\nan area that you\u0026rsquo;re intimately familiar with, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably very\nobvious to you why the work matters. This will be much less\nobvious to folks who don\u0026rsquo;t think about the area as often. Start by\nexplaining why your work matters to the company.\nEveryone loves a narrative. Another aspect of framing the topic\nis providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and\nwhere you\u0026rsquo;re going now. This should be a sentence or two along\nthe lines of, \u0026ldquo;Last year, we had trouble closing several important\ncustomers due to concerns about our scalability. We identified\nour databases as our constraints to scaling, and since then our\nfocus has been moving to a new sharding model that enables\nhorizontal scaling. That\u0026rsquo;s going well, and we expect to finish in Answer directly. Senior leaders tend to be indirectly responsible\nfor wide areas, and frequently pierce into areas to debug\nproblems. Their experience \u0026ldquo;debug piercing\u0026rdquo; tunes their radar for\nevasive answers, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a blip on that screen.\nInstead of hiding problems, use them as an opportunity to explain\nyour plans to address them.\nDeep in the data. You should be deep enough in your data that\nyou can use it to answer unexpected questions. This means\nspending time exploring the data, and the most common way to\ndo that is to run a thorough goal-setting exercise.\nDerive actions from principles. One of your aims is to provide a\nmental model of how you view the topic, allowing folks to get\nfamiliar with how you make decisions. Showing you are \u0026ldquo;in the\ndata\u0026rdquo; is part of this. The other aspect is defining the guiding\nprinciples you\u0026rsquo;re using to approach decisions.\nDiscuss the details. Some executives test presenters by diving\ninto the details, trying to uncover an area the presenter is\nuncomfortable speaking on. You should be familiar with the\ndetails, e.g., project statuses, but I think that it\u0026rsquo;s usually best to\nreframe the discussion when you get too far into the details. Try\nto pop up to either the data or the principles, which tend to be\nmore useful conversations.\nPrepare a lot; practice a little. If you\u0026rsquo;re presenting to your entire\ncompany, practicing your presentation is time well spent.\nLeadership presentations tend to quickly detour, so practice isn\u0026rsquo;t\n38\nquite as useful. Practice until you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable, but prefer to\nprepare instead getting deeper into the data, details, and\nprinciples. As a corollary, if you\u0026rsquo;re knowledgeable in the area\nyou\u0026rsquo;re responsible for, and have spent time getting comfortable\nwith the format, over time you\u0026rsquo;ll find that you won\u0026rsquo;t need to\nprepare much for these specifically. Rather, whether you\u0026rsquo;re able\nto present effectively without much preparation will become a\nsignal for whether you\u0026rsquo;re keeping up with your span of\nresponsibility.\nMake a clear ask. If you don\u0026rsquo;t go into a meeting with leadership\nwith a clear goal, your meeting will either go nowhere or go\npoorly. Start the meeting by explicitly framing your goal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis refined list of goals, aligned to your company\u0026rsquo;s priorities,\nthen becomes a central artifact for how you and your manager\ncollaborate on your career evolution. Every quarter or so, take\nsome time to refresh the document and review it together.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unconvinced that it\u0026rsquo;s worth your time to write a career\nnarrative, you certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have to write one. Most folks get\naway with not writing one for their entire career and have deeply\nfulfilling careers despite the absence.\nThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-\ncovering the same patch. Don\u0026rsquo;t go there.

A very difficult and long book, but decidedly illuminating. Taleb is sharply polemical and candid, offering a unique perspective on modern economics and the fragility of systems.

The absence of stress and competition, as well as an overabundance of choices, harms us.

I have to say the read was engaging, a 4-star for the author\u0026rsquo;s humor (same vibe as Uncanny Valley) as he pokes fun, with solid satire, at the UN\u0026rsquo;s machinery, which at the time was operating in Iraq for the Food-for-Oil program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, the story is that Saddam\u0026rsquo;s regime sold oil to a roster of companies and trusted figures, who took a cut to resell it at a higher price worldwide, giving a portion back (kickback) to Iraq.

A couple of final chapters were too tough, but otherwise I came away amazed and fascinated by this complicated world I did not know. One of the most beautiful and useful books I have ever read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecode means a system for transferring information among people and machines, aka to communicate. The Italian vocabulary is itself a code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction with Morse code used to communicate between two houses by the child protagonists who only have flashlights, already impressive. Key idea is two: dots and dashes, binary. Introduction to powers of two to explain the number of possible combinations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to Braille, which has a fascinating history and an ingenious structure that saves a lot of space with abbreviations and prefixes that alter the following words (shift codes). With two to the sixth combinations, a reminder of binary concepts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to electricity and how a flashlight works\u0026hellip; the battery has many atoms exchanging electrons, closing the circuit with a chemical reaction between the two ends. I = E/R, with current as how much electricity is flowing (Ampere), Resistance (Ohm) is how much the material blocks it, and E is voltage, how much potential energy there is. A disconnected battery always has the same voltage, but very high resistance since air does not conduct. Useful. Wattage for light bulbs is E x I\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSurprising: you can use grounding to conduct electricity using the Earth itself. Plant a large copper rod (symbolizes the beginning of the circuit, aka V). This way you do not need a second wire because the ground closes the circuit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of the telegraph, which opened and closed circuits making a click-clack sound to be translated into Morse code. Connections were copper wire between the first utility poles. Explanation of repeaters, which connected the click-clack sounder to the input and repeated the same thing instead of requiring human effort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of number systems, which are themselves a code. For me the number 3 stands for three because I assign that meaning to it. Zero was a tremendous invention. A digression on non-decimal systems by pretending to be a cartoon character with 8 fingers (brilliant, you understand how a base-8 system thinks by excluding 8 and 9). Excellent introduction to the bit, which is the binary digit (reasoning with a code of only 0 and 1, explained well by simulating being a dolphin with only two fingers/fins)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHistory of binary code, the simplest possible system for counting. Any information can be broken down and expressed in bits. For example a barcode is a sequence of spaces and lines symbolizing 0 and 1 in succession, and since there are many they allow 2 to the x combinations of codes. They have a lot of checks to prevent a barcode from being tampered with or misprinted (but in the end the same numbers are printed in clear text under the code). Shows both Morse and Braille converted into binary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of Boole and boolean logic. It connects to logic gates, which use current in series and in parallel to simulate + and x statements as if they were switches. Good parallel on how they physically correspond to current on and off and I learned AND, NAND, OR, and NOR\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBinary machine: build an adder from the components of the previous chapter. Introduced the XOR gate, which gives 1 if only one of A or B is 1, combining OR and NAND. Use an XOR and an AND to add bits with a carry if both are 1 (10). It ends up looking like this. PCs still use a system like this at the base, but obviously with microscopic, fast transistors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSubtraction is like addition but uses borrow instead of carry. If both bits are one you take the borrow from the column to the left and not the right. Overview of the machine with this feature, similar structure. To avoid the hassle of borrow it uses a trick with 9s called nine\u0026rsquo;s complement. Mathematical detail I can skip here. Introduction to overflow, which warns you if the number is larger than the bits available. To combine add and subtract it has another gate that defines the operation. If subtract, it simply inverts B with the ones\u0026rsquo; complement (like 9s but in binary). For example 9 - 4 will be 9 + (-4). Another trick for signs: instead of using a separate bit for the minus, split the available bits. For example from 0 to 499 the positives, and from 500 to 999 the negatives. This causes errors so that if you run out of bits then from 499 + 1 you go to -499. Now I get it. The leftmost bit will be 0 for positives and 1 for negatives. A number with this property is signed vs unsigned, and subtraction works in this somewhat convoluted way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeedback: introduces an oscillator, a relay with input = output that alternates quickly between 0 and 1. It can also be called a clock because it oscillates at regular, measurable intervals, aka cycles per second aka Hertz. It also covers flip-flops, which are a cross-coupled feedback of two NORs to remember the system state. A complex trick to create a latch, which allows setting and resetting a variable to a number, which can then be connected to the previous machine. They are also very useful for counting on each oscillation. I got lost here, I admit it, but I understand why they count so quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to hexadecimal code, the one used in colors, which for numbers beyond 9 uses A, B, \u0026hellip; F. Brilliant. It is used because 8 bits are a byte, and for big numbers two bytes are enough, so base sixteen is convenient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscusses memory, in particular RAM which stores some bytes to read and write information quickly not in sequence (as if it were a locker). ROM instead is sequential, and uses a control panel to access the appropriate addresses\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutomation: very dense chapter about opcodes and assembly, and how we can use two RAMs to store information (example of addition and multiplication). Here it goes into memory addresses, in this case 2 bytes, and there is a third byte for the instruction, which can be Load, Add, Subtract, Carry with Zero, Halt, and other precise situations. Quite heavy because it is more complicated than that, but in practice it works like this, and we have just seen the split between Data and Code. One RAM stores data in memory and accepts instructions in the form of other encoded bytes. To reread\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecap of the history of computers, from the first abaci to Babbage to the founder of IBM who used punch cards to Turing and Von Neumann, of which we built a replica earlier. They first use vacuum tubes and telephone relays, but transistors revolutionize everything by being semiconductors. They use metals like silicon between two doped layers of semiconductors that reduce heat and size. Chips exploit this layering even more to pack many connectors into a small space. Moore created this law about power roughly doubling every few years. In the end a computer moves a byte from one place to another, back and forth. Speed is essential for power, which is why there has been a race to put as many bits as possible on each microprocessor and to improve materials. Very complex chapter on how they handle information at that level and on how x86, x64, and company do not play well together\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eASCII and characters. Computers have everything in bits so how we want to display them depends on the chosen format, meaning how we choose to translate bits into text. Baudot assigns two hex bits for 30 letters, with a special one to switch to numbers if needed (like CAPS). ASCII standardizes hex into characters and is essential for computers to understand each other. It has a very interesting feature where you can subtract 20h to go from uppercase to lowercase. It was created with punch cards where you chose the hex and wrote things for the computer. Since they had not accounted for Asian writing systems and special symbols, Unicode was introduced with 16 bits and 65k characters. A bit larger but much less ambiguous\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePart about the bus I will skip because I did not understand it. RAM and ROM\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOperating System. This is indeed a challenge because when you turn off the PC, RAM loses everything it had in memory. An OS has a sequence of commands to reestablish the situation and is used to set commands for the computer in memory. Line by line the data is saved in memory thanks to OS instructions. Included there is a file system, which contains all the paths of objects, which are essentially memory addresses. Introduction to CP/M, a very basic system, and the subsequent rise of Linux, UNIX, GNU. Interesting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to fractional and irrational numbers, which we still need to represent in bits. Idea of fixed-point format where there is a certain bit with the decimal fixed, for example two decimal places. There is also floating-point notation where you express the number in a particular decimal notation. Very efficient, but it becomes less precise with large numbers so for banks and the like you keep fixed point, while for something like YouTube views floating is fine. To do operations with this complexity of floating points Intel had to make a dedicated chip in the 80s\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMicroprocessors do not understand assembly language so you need to translate it into bytes, that is, compile it, turning it into an executable. Compilers are even tougher because they synthesize commands in high-level languages into a few bytes and this requires structure. Low-level languages can communicate more directly with the machine and this can lead to interesting performance tricks like bit shifting accumulation. Uses ALGOL as a reference for a high-level language, which feels familiar. The low-level part had me lost in the instructions, it is now less useful in general cases. Example program in ALGOL, very familiar structure, and a brief history of the evolution of programs, from COBOL to FORTRAN to C, Lisp and company\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGraphics section.

First, park in a safe spot where you can take your time. For a small puncture you can temporarily use foam sealant. If you need to change it you need a jack and a four-way lug wrench. Read the manual, lift the car at the designated point with the jack and loosen the lug nuts. You may need force and a bit of oil. Bring a rag just in case. I saw how to do it in Switzerland: remember to put out the triangle and wear the vest, then work calmly, remove the hubcap if it\u0026rsquo;s clipped in, possibly the wheel cover, then place the jack where indicated (about 16 cm from the tire), loosen the nuts a bit, lift until you have a finger of clearance, remove the nuts without losing them, swap the wheel, tighten in a criss-cross pattern to balance the load, lower the car and give the nuts a final tighten, then drive off without rushing. Lesson learned.\nAnother tip: if the jack fails and the car drops, you might not be able to lift it again. Place wood or something sturdy as a safety support, and if the ground is unstable chock the other wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Oil leaks: if you see a spot under the car, identify the source. Engine oil is black, washer fluid is blue, transmission fluid is dark red/brown, and coolant varies. If it\u0026rsquo;s very oily, it\u0026rsquo;s likely a lubricant. You can try to trace the source and see if a gasket is leaking and can be fixed, but you will likely need a mechanic to replace it. Not an emergency but deal with it soon. Be careful tightening fittings so you don\u0026rsquo;t damage them, do it gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Oil warning light in general: if it\u0026rsquo;s yellow the level is probably low or the pressure is off. Pull over, wait 15 minutes, then use the dipstick to check the level. If it\u0026rsquo;s low, buy some oil at the nearest station and top up at the oil filler cap. Not urgent, but low oil can damage the engine over time, and if it runs out the engine can fail. If the level looks fine or the light behaves oddly (red or flashing), that\u0026rsquo;s a concern.

Wait a bit, then start yours and let it recharge while still connected, then take a short drive to confirm all is okay. When working on a battery always remove the negative cable first and reconnect it last. Check for corrosion now and then, and remove it with a small brush if needed. Batteries often have a hydrometer eye indicator that shows, by color, if it\u0026rsquo;s charged, discharged, or needs service.\nStill on the battery, test before replacing: charge it and see if it holds. If it cannot hold a charge, it is done.

This nice video shows how to change it. Not a big concern, aside from the first time when all the fluid drains out, which can be surprising. Depends on the car. It only costs 10-30 euros at a mechanic, so I would let them do it. Check the car\u0026rsquo;s instructions to know which coolant you need. I tend to confuse it, probably an antifreeze/coolant mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throttle body (3️⃣) is a key engine component and can be cleaned easily.

You can also open the hood and see if there is debris in the air intake (filters 2️⃣). The book then describes a more involved disinfecting with specific products, worth reading up on.

For others there are kits to repair as soon as possible before it becomes a crack. It must be completely dry, and you apply the kit carefully to the glass, which looks like a small patch or an injector of adhesive, depending on the kit. See if it works. If the crack spreads, the glass is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStoring your car for a long time. Read the Storing Your Car chapter.

Remove as much water as possible before mold grows, there will be water everywhere. If it reaches the ECU there may be irreparable damage, check the high-water mark carefully. Check the oil filter; if it has water droplets you may need an oil change. If water got inside, air out and clean mats and interior, and rinse external components that may have gotten dirty like the brakes. The onboard computer should be removed and cleaned with great care since it is not waterproof. Also check the lights. In theory they are fine, but water can get in and you need to dry the housing. In general electrical components are protected. Test thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepair paint chips (💥). Since a body shop can be expensive, you can try to fix it by buying primer and clearcoat, because the paint is layered. Mask the area to fill, sand it (the book lists grits) and apply the suggested products. Again, check the chapter images. If you are not satisfied, you can try spray paint (still masking the area) and then lightly sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Removing stickers (maybe the vignette).

Wear eye protection because of flying debris, and you cut the pipe. I will not do this, so if it happens I will read that chapter. Most issues are rust.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Suspension (3️⃣ restore if used hard): you notice because the car takes hits poorly, like a truck. I think the book focuses on SUVs/vans in this chapter. You unscrew and inspect various components, especially shocks. They should be replaced about every 60k miles, depending on use, but replacement is complex. I saw a video and I would not do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange oil and filter (the car alerts you): there is a video on how, but you need a way to raise the car. I will have a mechanic do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange the water pump (1️⃣0️⃣): watch if coolant temperature climbs a lot; around 100k km it should be replaced. Be alert if there are leaks, which is rare, since it can seriously damage the engine. If you smell coolant, pay attention. With recent tech it should be reliable anyway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The starter solenoid (or starter motor) is the device that engages the engine with the battery when you turn the key. If it fails you hear click-click-click as it spins without engaging (happened before). Could also be a battery issue. On the Dacia I will not touch it, it is just useful to know this component exists, like a small switch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Ignition timing matters. The timing belt is a gear system you might adjust if the engine struggles to accelerate. There is a close-up of what I mean. They mark the current position on the pulley and turn it a certain way. I doubt I will ever do this. If needed, reread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The engine mount (5️⃣ they start to crack) protects the engine from shocks and vibrations. If it has issues you notice jerks and engine vibrations. Replace if needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The cooling fan is one or two large fans that run the AC and help cool the engine. If it fails you will get hot air and risk overheating. They show how to check the connectors with a battery, and you can test the fan directly. I doubt I can do much beyond that. Replacing it is involved; you have to remove a lot around the engine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe transmission filter (and fluid) (3️⃣). There is a video that gives the idea. It reminds me of the oil filter and I may be mixing them up. I would have a mechanic do it since it takes some skill (unscrew, clean, scrape), though it is not the most complex job. It matters because it manages the driven wheels. Do they do this during service? If it is not right, steering or response may feel off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHitching a trailer, if I ever need it.

Example: an online courses company that kept adding new items to hit targets, but everything was rushed and poorly done, and users did not use it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. Focus on end results, not on what you produced\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA product has no inherent value. What matters is what it does for the customer, e.g., solving a problem\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you do not measure the impact of your work on the customer, you will never know which outcomes you are delivering\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSales-led organizations do not work. Sales does not know what to bring, so they overpromise, and IT struggles. The process should start with the product manager, who listens to the customer, focuses on a problem, tests a feature on a small scale, and provides Sales with a roadmap they can take forward\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo product-led companies set a general strategy, then follow with features to achieve that goal (e.g., increase the number of courses per instructor), prioritizing projects with the highest impact\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConcept of known knowns and unknown unknowns. Plan with what you know and what you expect not to know.

You need a strategy and core values to follow, making hard choices without straying from them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is not a plan. It is a decision-making framework\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExamples of good frameworks: DIBBs (Spotify) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Data, Insights, Beliefs, and Bets. OKRs (Google, others) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Objectives \u0026amp; Key Results. BPM (Twilio, via First Round) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Big Picture, Priorities, Measures\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVision: more of a general direction that guides philosophical choices over the long term. Always keep it in mind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo clarify the differences. Netflix example: Strategic intent = lead the streaming market.  Product initiative = enable people to watch Netflix on any device, wherever viewers wanted to. Options = Roku, Xbox app, partnerships with internet-enabled TVs, iPad App, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemember to say no to less important things to make time for innovation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"part-iv-product-management-process\"\u003ePART IV: PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PROCESS\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduces Toyota Kata, an example of a system for creating products from a problem-solving mindset\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMetrics are critical.

Quarterly Business Reviews, Product Initiative Reviews, Release Reviews\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBudgeting is important.

The first check, broadly, is \u0026ldquo;editing by a chainsaw.\u0026rdquo; Cut the big parts that do not fit or do not explain your idea clearly. Your idea should be presented right away at the start, without preambles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen look at the paragraphs: does each one have an idea that was not in the one before or after? Then keep it. Otherwise, cut. \u0026ldquo;Think of sentences in a paragraph as a conversation between an elderly, companionable couple.

We usually leverage several storage solutions, since each kind of DB works best in a specific environment. Questions to ask when choosing: is it compatible with our speed rates, could it be a bottleneck, do we understand how the tech works, will it anticipate future scale, will the vendor guarantee the SLA, do we capture metadata, is it pure (object storage) or does it support query patterns (cloud DWH), is it schemaless/hybrid/enforced, how are we tracking records and schemas and governance. Also remember the difference between hot and cold data (for compliance but not accessed)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIngestion: this is usually the bottleneck of the data architecture, while source systems, the biggest culprit, are not under our control or responsibility. Focus on making a reliable system by asking these questions: the use cases, what systems generate the data and when they are available, what the data destination is, how frequently we need to access the data and in which volume, what their format is, whether it is in good shape or we need to modify it. Plus differences between batch and streaming ingestion; usually batch is more efficient and simpler (and far more used unless you have a critical need for live data)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTransformation: the stage where you transform the data before the next parts of the process. This is mostly related to changing types, removing errors, schema changes, and normalization. Consider costs and keep transformations as simple as possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eServing: you can use the data in different ways. Analytics, ML, and reverse ETL are the most popular. With analytics we talk about BI (which often requires further cleaning, and ideally a self-service approach), or operational/embedded analytics (for example, inventory live or customer dashboards). ML is straightforward here. Reverse ETL is the process of putting data back into source systems, long considered an antipattern, but often a necessity (for example, marketing using sales data and uploading forecasts back into the system)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecurity: the principle of least privilege is crucial, and also giving access only for the duration necessary to perform the work\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefinition:\nEnterprise architecture is the design of systems to support change in the enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through careful evaluation of trade-offs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePillars of a good data architecture:\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChoose common components wisely.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlan for failure.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArchitect for scalability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArchitecture is leadership.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways be architecting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuild loosely coupled systems. → See Bezos API Mandate where every team must communicate by API only\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake reversible decisions → Bezos two-way door\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrioritize security → Zero trust security etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmbrace FinOps → DevOps with Finance involved\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrownfield (replace legacy systems) vs Greenfield: in both cases be cautious and assess a strategy that slowly brings in the new feature, cleaning up progressively\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eData Mart (DWH for analytics, further step) vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso mentions the data lakehouse as a likely future direction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTalking about the modern stack: key concepts are self-service, agile data management, and clear pricing/open source\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: the Lambda (batch and stream to be joined together) and Kappa (one giant stream, expensive at scale) architectures were introduced for managing large real-time streaming data.

In recent decades we have reduced the share of people suffering from hunger from 65% in the 1950s to 10% today by increasing production and efficiency with machines and fertilizers that require a lot of fuel.

Instead of boring me with Oracle technical details (which are briefly touched on) Cary talks about how to communicate, understand the problem, and optimize it.

It was natural selection. Under given environmental conditions only the most suited survive; the others die. Those who survive have offspring and pass their traits to their children. Generation after generation, the most suitable traits are selected. But note: Darwin reached these conclusions many years after his return.

It drags on a bit at the end and tries to reinforce the vibe with stories of Product Managers (like the one who split Word for Mac from Word for Windows).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo more roadmaps. That waterfall setup where the requirement comes from the customer or sales, you discuss, you make a roadmap, is outdated. The push should come from devs and managers, let ideas move fast, and test.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe old style: you build features no one cares about and then polish them. The team is not involved, design does not work in sync, and more.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe issue is that about half of our ideas will not work. Requirements change, people want something else. So we need to fail fast.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso it takes multiple iterations to make things work before delivering value, but often the business is afraid and in a rush. The team gets involved too late to evaluate the idea.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRisks must be addressed up front, not at the end.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA good team is key to a strong product. They should be aware of the risks (value, usability, feasibility, business viability). They should collaborate across the parts and, above all, solve a business problem.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuestions to ask during discovery:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill the user pay for it?

(feasibility)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan our stakeholders support it?

A team should be at most what two pizzas can feed (8 to 12 people).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe PM role is tough. Understand the customer and the product. Sit next to every member of the team: Design, Engineering, Marketing. Also the customer, the tester, anyone who touches the problem.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving strong players, in sync and aligned, is key. Share challenges and problems with them; do not shield or hide them. Everything should be in sync.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse analysts and marketing to get more insights on how to sell well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo the roadmap should be bottom up, with lots of prototypes, fail fast, and iterate. Identify high value items first and avoid committing too hard in one direction. Stay flexible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore nebulous chapters on the various stakeholders (head of sales, head of engineering, etc).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso nebulous chapters on vision, strategy, and OKRs. OKRs are discouraged and complicated. In a startup it is simple: bring in cash.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe main job of a product manager is discovery. Ask questions like\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill the customer buy it? (prove value)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill users figure out how to use it? (check usability)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill we be able to build it? (ask about feasibility)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWill our business benefit from it, and will we cover the costs? (verify viability)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not try to please everyone. Pick a market segment and test there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever tell people how to do something. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving a solid demo and prototype matters. Present it well so stakeholders can get a feel for what you are building.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe excited about the product. Otherwise you will not inspire others.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWithout a strong product, marketing cannot sell, which leads to requests for more features, which wastes more time, which means you still do not have a strong product.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe customer often does not know what they want, so we need to discover and test their needs and share what we have done.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechniques for doing this:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFraming (align on goals, do an assessment with an enlightened customer on what is needed)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlanning: story mapping, activities and stories to identify the system, or leverage a Reference Customer, your nurtured customer who promotes you to others for free\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdeation: customer interviews and tests, hack days, prototyping\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOfficial tests like usability testing, viability, value testing, etc. For that you need a working prototype\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow? It suggests design sprints, weeks where devs can invent and build what inspires them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCulture: a good team tests a lot, validates ideas with the end customer, knows they will often fail, and celebrates outcomes, not features.

Bressanini explains very clearly (as he does on YouTube) and does not hesitate to use big chemistry terms that many readers might skip, but they still lend professionalism to the result. I focused on the practical information, without diving into all the technicalities, and here is a general home guide I built from the key points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlthough we tend to be wary of chemical products at the supermarket and prefer grandma\u0026rsquo;s compounds (like vinegar, lemon, etc.), chemists have refined these formulas for decades and they will usually do a better job than DIY mixes. There are strict European regulations on this; they are safe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever mix substances together. You risk generating toxic gases. At best, combinations like an acid and a base (vinegar + baking soda) cancel each other out, so the result is worse.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTake time to read ingredient lists. People fear long chemical names like triphosphate or sodium hydroxide, but every compound has a technical name and a lot is marketing. Do not be misled.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt all depends on pH: acidic soils are removed with alkaline products, and vice versa.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarketing plays a big role. Many products do roughly the same thing since the core chemistry is similar. That does not mean you should always buy the cheapest option, but you do not need to overspend either. Results are often similar. Try a product and stick with what works best for you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-limescale\"\u003e1. Limescale\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLimescale is calcium carbonate that forms from heated water. Calcium precipitates and sticks to surfaces like shower walls, toilets, and faucets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ It is not harmful to humans. In fact, our bodies use calcium. Drinking hard water can contribute calcium to the diet.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVinegar dissolves calcium carbonate, so it is a valid traditional solution, but it smells and is not acidic enough to be very effective. Purpose-made descalers work better. Bressanini examines Viakal (not as a specific recommendation, but as an example of a solid product) and its composition: water, citric acid to dissolve limescale, surfactants to increase solubility in water, citrate and sodium hydroxide to regulate pH, fragrances and colorants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese products are good for cleaning sanitary ware and damaged ceramics. There are specific notes for special cases (for example, scratches in a bathtub might be permanent). One tip: use low-mineral bottled water in coffee machines because limescale can damage them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2-soaps\"\u003e2. Soaps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarseille soap is not necessarily made in Marseille and is not a registered trademark. The term usually refers to a hard soap. So-called neutral soap is also a marketing term; soap must be alkaline (pH 9+) to remove dirt. It simply means it has no free caustic soda.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSkipping the history here. Today there are two main soap bases: coconut or palm kernel oils that bring lauric acid and produce more foam, and palm oil or tallow that foam less and harden the bar. Commercial blends are often around 70% palm and 30% coconut, but it varies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost soaps are broadly similar in composition. Marketing adds small amounts of scented oils, but they are a tiny fraction. Read the ingredients and you will see them near the end.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3-detergents-and-laundry-detergents\"\u003e3. Detergents and laundry detergents\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese are ideal for removing almost any type of soil from fabrics, but they can struggle with greasy residues (often from skin or food).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA key component is surfactants: special molecules that are half hydrophobic and half hydrophilic. They trap soil and bind to water, carrying the dirt away.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA good detergent has surfactants (higher-end products may have up to 50%, which are costly), polymers to disperse dirt in water, enzymes to break down soil, a small percentage of fragrances, and optical brighteners. Fun fact: a brightener does not make laundry whiter by removing dirt. It lays a fluorescent layer that makes fabrics appear brighter.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ At the supermarket you can choose powder or liquid detergents (plus capsules and pods). In general they are all decent. Powders are slightly more effective and economical, but their performance drops if you wash below 60 C. Since in Europe we often wash at 30 to 40 C, liquids work better at those temperatures. Pods are convenient and often contain compartmentalized blends that combine during the wash to boost performance, so they can be more effective. Downside: you cannot adjust the dose as freely, so there is less flexibility.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor wool and silk, read the label carefully. Hand washing with dedicated detergents is recommended.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"4-bleach-and-chlorine\"\u003e4. Bleach and chlorine\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDetergents are not always effective on greasy residues. For stubborn stains we use strong oxidizers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFun fact: bleach does not simply destroy soil. It removes the molecules that cause color and helps detergents by breaking down proteins and carbohydrates. Hypochlorite solutions are also very alkaline (pH 13+).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The term \u0026ldquo;bleach\u0026rdquo; is ambiguous. In Europe, bleach usually means sodium hypochlorite, a strong oxidizer that can remove color from dyed fabrics. Use on whites. \u0026ldquo;Delicate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;color-safe\u0026rdquo; bleach is a completely different oxygen-based compound.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Household bleach is usually diluted (3 to 5% hypochlorite). Higher concentration usually means more aggressive action. In Europe, use it in the dedicated compartment, cold, before the wash, and you do not need large amounts or high temperatures. For tough stains you can pre-treat briefly in a basin before washing (always wash afterward). Check the label.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLabel symbols: an empty triangle means you can bleach, a crossed-out triangle means you cannot. A triangle with two diagonal lines means you can use non-chlorine (oxygen-based) bleach only.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not let it degrade. Heat, time, and light reduce its effectiveness.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Never mix bleach with other substances. It can create toxic gases. Handle with care. Do not use it on food. It corrodes metals and is useless against limescale.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"5-percarbonate-and-oxygen\"\u003e5. Percarbonate and oxygen\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHere we are talking about oxygen-based bleaches, marketed as \u0026ldquo;delicate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;color-safe\u0026rdquo; bleach, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Hydrogen peroxide is mainly used as a disinfectant for minor wounds, and the book does not focus on it. In a pinch you can dilute it in water to treat a stain, but at low temperatures it needs a long time (overnight).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Color-safe bleach typically contains 3 to 5% hydrogen peroxide and can be used to pre-treat a colored garment with tough stains before washing, or added in the washing machine bleach compartment. It is more effective at 60 C and above.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo not mix it randomly with other chemicals. You can generate unwanted reactions, splashes, or gases.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBressanini analyzes Omino Bianco color-safe bleach: it contains water (solvent), hydrogen peroxide to bleach, surfactants to reach stains, etidronic acid to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, fragrances like linalool and citronellol, sodium sulfate to stabilize electrolytes, dimethicone as an antifoam, and colorants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Hydrogen peroxide is very effective for removing blood from handkerchiefs and walls. Apply a little with a cotton swab.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"6-laundry\"\u003e6. Laundry\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways read the care labels. A washtub with an X or a crossed-out circle (meaning even professional dry cleaning is not allowed) means do not wash. You can test stain removal on a small hidden area first. A hand in a basin means hand wash only.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe machine washing symbol is a washtub with a number of degrees. One or two lines underneath indicate delicate cycles and you should reduce or skip spinning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The best wash is not washing. Since washing uses resources, you do not need to wash a garment every time you wear it, especially if it was not in contact with skin. If there are no visible stains or odors, air it and use it again. Skipping a wash is good for the environment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Many stains should be pre-treated because they are hard to remove. Main categories:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWater-soluble (sugar, toothpaste, salt) → rinse or wash\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParticulate (charcoal, ash, burnt residues, soil, rust) → bleach and detergent are not helpful; use soap and scrub\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrease (oil, butter, sauce, makeup, sebum, body oils, lubricant) → best option is surfactants in detergents, specific stain removers, or in a pinch shampoo, which shares some ingredients. Let it work, then rinse thoroughly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBleachable (many types: chlorophyll, fruit/vegetable stains, tea, coffee, henna, mustard, curry) → detergents may suffice, but a bleach can finish the job\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnzyme-treatable (various: blood, grass, body fluids, eggs, milk) → use proteases at room temperature, since heat sets proteins. They should be in detergents; check the label. Otherwise use bleach.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor yellowed linens (oxidation of sebum or cellulose) try a bleaching treatment once. If the fibers are degraded, there is nothing to do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Do not underestimate fabric softeners. They are designed to keep fibers soft and reduce friction. There is a lot of marketing since the core formula is similar (cationic surfactants that protect the fabric from limescale). Scents vary, so pick what you like. Do not use too much or it can coat the fabric and leave it greasy. It can irritate skin and, if overused, may reduce durability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"7-dishes-pots-and-glasses\"\u003e7. Dishes, pots, and glasses\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The dishwasher is by far the most effective way to wash dishes. About 90% of the cleaning power is the mechanical action of water (the rest is heat and a small contribution from detergent). Bressanini debunks the idea that handwashing is more ecological or effective: dishwashers clean roughly 3 to 4 times better and use little (around 10 L and a few tens of watts in ECO mode). Handwashing can use 35 to 470 L and can account for about 50% of household water use. It is a clear win.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandwashing is fine if you have no alternative. It is better to soak items in a basin with water and detergent, then rinse, to avoid wasting water.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Pre-rinsing dishes before the dishwasher is largely unnecessary. Modern machines are powerful. Unless it is a heavily encrusted pot (they are less effective there), you do not need to pre-rinse. If needed, run a second cycle or clean it afterward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Use dishwasher-specific detergents. They foam less, include enzymes, small amounts of surfactants (to prevent redeposition since cleaning is mechanical), bleaches, anti-limescale agents, and silicates to protect glass.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can choose powders, liquids, tablets, or pods. They are interchangeable. Liquids, gels, and pods can be more convenient. Try products and choose what convinces you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBleach food containers with deep tomato stains. Tomato pigments are hard to remove from plastic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse dishwasher salt. It is similar to table salt but purer, so it will not damage the appliance. It costs a bit more. Do not skimp.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf glasses turn cloudy, it could be manufacturing defects, deposits, or irreversible abrasion. If you notice permanent clouding, there is nothing to do; replace the glasses. You can try a different detergent and ensure you use rinse aid to help prevent it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"8-disinfectants\"\u003e8. Disinfectants\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThese are tightly regulated devices. By law they must eliminate 99.99% of bacteria on a surface. There are complex requirements, but in general they must act quickly and not be toxic when used as directed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Focus on where to use them. Most transmission occurs, in order:\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhere food is handled (cutting boards, sponges)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEating with unwashed hands\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing toilets or changing a diaper\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCoughing/sneezing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther (in order: surfaces touched by a sick person, contaminated laundry, animals, trash, other infected people)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ As we see, floors and even dirty clothes are relatively low risk, since we do not eat off them. Disinfecting them constantly, unless there is an immunocompromised person, is wasteful, and microbes return within hours.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeveral forms exist: concentrates, sprays, wipes (convenient but less effective).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther substances can disinfect in principle, like hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, or bleach, but they are not formulated for this purpose on surfaces. If you have nothing else, OK, but purpose-made disinfectants are much more effective.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The best way to disinfect a sponge is the microwave. It kills the vast majority of microbes thanks to the high temperature and microwaves. Bressanini cites a study recommending placing the sponge in a vented container for one minute at maximum power.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDisinfectants kill molds, so they are recommended for cleaning the fridge and cutting boards. On moldy walls there is often little to do; spores can persist in porous surfaces.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ The fear of pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables is generally overstated in Europe. Regulations are strict. Unless you are pregnant and need extra precautions, rinsing produce under running water is enough. In one study only about 1% of samples were above safety limits, and about 60% had no detectable residues.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"9-baking-soda\"\u003e9.

It is not made for cleaning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ It is an antacid, useful for heartburn. It neutralizes vinegar, so using them together (a common traditional tip) cancels them out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt softens vegetables, which can speed up cooking when added to the water. It is also useful for absorbing acidic liquids.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt does not wash, does not degrease, does not dissolve limescale, does not whiten, does not sanitize, does not capture odors (it masks them), does not disinfect, and does not unclog drains.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"10-glass-and-surfaces\"\u003e10. Glass and surfaces\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor mirrors, Bressanini looks at Vetril (which I also use): water, ethyl alcohol to dissolve fats, surfactants to capture dirt, preservatives, and fragrances. Nothing special.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCarpets and furniture: use specific products. For floors, a mop with an appropriate cleaner works well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Classic clogged drain: this happens because solid residues build up in the pipe (often food). In extreme cases you need a plumber (there must be at least a trickle of water; if totally blocked avoid forcing it). Before that, try in this order (ignore bad advice online; do not use baking soda):\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn acid to dissolve limescale: vinegar or citric acid is fine, better when warm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA couple of liters of hot water around 60 C to dissolve solidified grease\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCaustic soda (sodium hydroxide) for protein residues; many drain openers use this\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA plunger if it is still clogged\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"11-odors\"\u003e11.

If you heat foods that absorb little, a good trick is to put a glass of water inside to absorb some of the waves, which could otherwise stress the appliance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"vegetables\"\u003eVegetables\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧅 Onion: a trick to stop tears is to wet the knife to reduce the impact of its enzymes, and do not face the cut side toward you (dice starting from the far side).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧄 Garlic: the enzyme that creates the smell reacts only when we cut or crush garlic. Avoid pre-minced garlic, which has lost its fresh aroma. Very healthy food (as he says for all vegetables). Do not crush it if you want a milder aroma. It can be stored in a cool, dark place for months.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍅 Tomato: technically a berry, and beyond the fun facts about its nature and flavor it keeps well at 13 to 22 C; in the fridge it loses a lot of aroma over time. If possible, keep it somewhere cool rather than cold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫑 Peppers: a trick is to soften them a bit in the microwave, sliced, since they contain a lot of water, then finish in a pan with oil and garlic. They do not tolerate cold very well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍏 Apples and other climacteric fruits like apricot, banana, pear, and tomato ripen based on ethylene, a signal that tells them to soften, turning starches into sugars. If an apple gets bruised, it darkens and, under stress, can release ethylene to the others, making them ripen and soften.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌵 Asparagus: best eaten just after harvest or soon after buying, since they keep growing fast, getting tougher and losing sugars. If it bends past 90 degrees it is not fresh; it should not be too flexible. The microwave is highly recommended to trap their flavorful juices inside and not lose them (3 to 4 minutes at 800 W). And yes, there is at least one molecule that makes them smell a bit because it is similar to what we use to odorize gas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌿 Basil: cut it chiffonade (roll the leaves, then slice into thin strips), great for salads with tomato. The best way is to buy a small plant to keep on the balcony, cutting stems and leaves 10 to 15 cm from the base, leaving two to four pairs to regrow. This way you get fresh basil for the whole summer. In the fridge it suffers from the cold; it is better to slice it and freeze it in a small bag (it will turn black, a cosmetic process similar to our tanning, but it keeps its aroma). You can also dry it in the microwave.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥕 Carrots: originally yellow and purple until the 1600s, then a genetic mutation led to the selection of orange ones, which were more convenient (purple ones colored broth purple and you could not see anything). Purple ones are called black carrots and are used a lot as a colorant.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫒 Oil: you can make it from many foods, olive, soy, sunflower, etc., and they are more or less interchangeable because there is no single specific molecule. They contain the same fatty acids, bound in triglycerides, in different percentages. We simplify to plant = unsaturated and animal = saturated, but not always true. Those are not interchangeable: they have different chemical properties, so replace saturated with saturated, especially in desserts. Virgin oils are made only with mechanical processes, with no chemical changes, and extra virgin have low free acids (less bitter flavor). Use extra virgin olive oil raw, and seed oils for frying and sauteing if possible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍆 Eggplant: it suffers from cold, so do not keep it too long in the fridge. Choose ones that spring back when pressed. Avoid a brown cap, which means it is old. Frying is tricky; better to give it a quick pass in the microwave for a couple of minutes so it does not absorb too much water and oil.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥔 Potatoes: store outside the fridge in the dark; watch light exposure, which causes solanine production, which is toxic. For mash, better to use a ricer than a blender, which breaks too many starch chains and makes it gluey. Boil potatoes with the skin; they absorb less water and keep a bit more nutrients. You can microwave them before frying, with a lid to increase effectiveness.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BbeRJiMPL._SL1203_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/books/la-scienza-delle-verdure/","title":"La Scienza Delle Verdure"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe author, a journalist for La Repubblica, writes in a slightly too novelistic way but effectively; the book kept me hooked for three straight days.

E devo dire che il libro mi ha molto impressionato sul lato dell’etica, perchè anche se il mio lavoro non impatta direttamente la vita delle persone, indirettamente le conseguenze sono molto rilevanti. Mike cita casi famosi come Cambridge Analytics o Greyball: qualcuno li ha progettati e creato il codice, ed è sua responsabilità.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl problema è che noi designer-creatori non abbiamo voce in capitolo spesso, facciamo quello che ci dicono di fare: obiettivo di “Ruined By Design” è di spronarci ad opporci a richieste non etiche, e essere i gateway per fare del mondo un posto migliore. Possiamo avere impatto su scelte molto importanti.

We will do this Saturday at noon.\nAFTER\nWe’re moving Jimmy’s party to the new trampoline park this Saturday at noon.\nWhy It Matter\nBEFORE\nThe only hitch is it’s a little farther than we originally planned. The rst spot we were\nlooking at was a 30-minute drive, but the trampoline park has a lot more space, so we\npicked it even though it’s about 40 minutes away.

Laying Plans\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet’s start by saying that Modeling is the projection of business requirements. Having a clear and structured model is the key to a reliable database, keeping in mind that it is still an approximation of the reality and no size it it all. We just want to avoid crazy queries.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNormalization is a logical process to data modeling, to be strictly followed when laying down the schema of a DB and minimize inconsistency: 3 steps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnsure Atomicity → use IDs instead of description/names to identify rows. You have to make sure that searching for, say, the customer, returns all the rows without worrying about misspelling or slow “like” statements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Dependence on the Whole Key → keep columns to a limit: e.g. if same car models share the same information about car details, move them to another table that can be joined through the car model key. Don’t keep redundant data in the main table for performance reasons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Attribute Independence → separate the independent attributes, for example country code details, which can be stored in another table connected through a non primary key to the row. This further minimized data redundancy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention with nulls: a red flag is when the majority of the columns contains null values, and if two columns can’t both be not null at the same time. Also, avoid using this kind of statement where color not in (\u0026lsquo;BLUE\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;BLACK\u0026rsquo;, null) because the engine doesn’t know what NULL is so there may be bugs (check with MSSQL though). In general, avoid nulls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTuning is about getting the best possible performance, now. When we develop, we must have a different mindset and not think “let’s code it, and then have a specialist tune it later in production.” Focus on not making a bad model, which is the main cause of bad performances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving different sources can be a performance killer, other than making the system more complex and difficult to maintain. Try to insert some rows locally and then through a DB Link. Centralizing data should be a key priority. The nearer you are to your data, the faster you can get at it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-waging-war\"\u003e2.

Leave comments in the code to explain when the code is used to eventually identify and track down issues. Make the statements identifiable!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA database connection is fundamentally a “heavy,” or high-resource operation. Don’t do like in the example, where for each line it was opening a connection! Try to insert data in chunks to maximize speed. However, this doesn’t scale too well when updating rows, better use one swoop statement to outperform them all\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStand back from your problem and possibly tackle the challenge with a fresh mind. Sometimes thinking outside the box can dramatically fix a problem, such as a performance issue that the author optimized with an UNION statement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaximize each visit to the database by asking for all the columns you will need in one single statement, even if you are not using them all immediately. If you have to retrieve different values (e.g. max and min date) don’t use two statements, for example!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing the DB native kernel and functions provided by the DBMS will always be more performant rather than building other abstraction layers on top of it (e.g. PL/SQL is slower than a SQL function)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid counting rows if not necessary (classic select count(*) into counter from table_name where \u0026lt;certain_condition\u0026gt; if (counter \u0026gt; 0) then \u0026hellip;). It is more performant to use native tools like @@ROWCOUNT or SQL%ROWCOUNT or MERGE when inserting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are several ways to achieve procedural logics in a DB application. Even if it is conceptually better to leave them at application level, leaving some logic in SQL can be way more performant. Loops don’t exist in SQL as it works on sets, and if conditions are the WHERE clauses. For else statements you can use CASE.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuccessive updates to a single table  are acceptable only if they affect different rows. Otherwise, combine the updates together to use the full power of indexes and avoid unnecessary visits!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid lookup functions when you can use joins. Sure, readability can decrease as in programming it’s good practice to simplify logic in functions, but the optimizer can’t examine the functions and performances are worse!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-tactical-dispositions\"\u003e3.

The performance decrease of one trigger is like the one with 2 indexes (Oracle)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are NOT a panacea. To justify the use of an index, it must provide benefit (including indexing foreign keys, that some systems do automatically but can cause locks and redundancy). The most efficient index is a unique one, with one row = one index value\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso, if you apply a function to the index (format, truncating a date, anything) the query will work but you will lose the advantages of the index\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSystem-generated incremental keys are an easy way to assign IDs, but can be a bottleneck in case of concurrent inserts, as there is one centralized generator assigning values to everyone.

The sooner we get rid of unnecessary data the less we have to process the query later\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention to DISTINCT, which can hide overlooked JOINS and it’s difficult to debug if you are missing data.

Einstein rejected black holes. Tidal forces are less at the horizon of large black holes. Einstein Equivalence Principle states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3 - Reimann proposed that space may be curved, an idea incorporated into General Relativity. Minkowski space incorporates space and time, with a world line representing the path of an object. Einstein discovered time dilation where rapidly moving clocks slow down. General Theory of Relativity states that objects move straight ahead through space-time. If space is curved, the object follows. Gravitational force is the curvature of space-time. John Wheeler proposed wormholes but they would stay open for so short a time that even light could not pass through. Einstein discovered (General Theory of Relativity) gravitational red shift where clocks slow down near a heavy mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4 - Duality of light - not only wavelike but particle like - Einstein 1905. Planck constant h = 6.62 x 10 exp -34.. Information conservation, or reversibility, states that given the present, one can construct the future and the past. Quantum Mechanics respects the conservation of information. Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle states that the greater the certainty of velocity, the lesser the certainty of position. m delta v delta x \u0026gt; h. When a system is derived of all energy it is in ground state. QM, however, states that particles are still in motion - zero point motion or the quantum jitters. Energy of a photon E = hf. In Quantum Field Theory, the path of a particle is a propagator. A split, such as in the release of a particle, is a vertex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5 - Planck found that if c, G (Newtons gravitational constant) and h are set to one, three fundamental Planck units result. The Planck length is very small (10 exp -35 m.), much smaller than a proton. Planck time (10 exp -42 sec) is very small, being the time it takes light to traverse the Planck length. Planck mass is about that of a dust mote. The energy equivalent is about equal to a tank of gasoline. The Planck length, time and mass are the size, half-life and mass of the smallest possible black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6 - The question of how black holes decay. A possibility is that quantum fluctuations would allow a piece of the horizon to fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7 - Equivalence of chemical, potential, kinetic and thermal energy. Conservation of energy is the First Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law states that entropy always increases. Entropy is a measure of the number of arrangements that conform to some specific recognizable criterion. Entropy is hidden information. Entropy increases because we lose track of the details over time. The smallest size containing a bit of information is a Planck length. Maximum amount of information that can be put into a region of space is equal to the area of the region, not the volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8 - John Wheeler stated that black holes have no hair, meaning the horizon was smooth. Adding one bit of information to a black hole increases its horizon by one square Planck length. Entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9 - Black holes have temperature which is inversely proportional to their size. Black holes are black bodies - they reflect no light. Black holes emit photons and therefore evaporate. A black hole the mass of the moon would be 1 deg K. One the mass of a boulder would be a billion billion deg. Photon emission from a BH is Hawking radiation. Hawking calculates that the entropy of a BH equals one quarter of the horizon area, measured in Planck units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10 - Hawking states that when a BH evaporates, the trapped bits of information disappear from the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11 - Particle collisions are described by an S or scattering matrix, which is reversible. Hawking invented the not S matrix or dollar matrix which is not reversible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12 - Surrounding space is warmer than astronomical BH\u0026rsquo;s, so they are still gathering mass rather than evaporating, although the evaporation rate is very slow. Einstein Equivalence Principle - the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13 - Susskind Antigravity Pill paradox where characters fall through a BH horizon. Apparently they are destroyed and emitted as evaporation products as required by QM. But apparently they also pass safely through the horizon as predicted by the Equivalence Principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14 - The possibility that a BH horizon is covered with quantum copying machines so that evaporation and passage are both possible. However, a quantum copying machine is not possible as it would violate Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15 - A BH stretched horizon is one Planck distance above the horizon. It is an energetic, hot layer. Susskind proposes complementarity whereby both alternatives of the paradox are true. No paradox because the observers on the inside and outside can never meet, so each story is true in it\u0026rsquo;s own zone of reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16 - It requires increasingly short wavelength (high energy) photons to observe smaller particles. As an atom falls closer to a horizon, it requires increasingly high energy photons to resolve them. So as the atom falls to the horizon, it becomes increasingly blurred and appears to spread out over the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17 - About Cambridge, religion and Hawkings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18 - The Holographic Principle - the contents of space are actually a holographic representation of the information on the area bounding that space. Perhaps all space / the universe is a hologram, coded on a distant two dimensional space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19 - String Theory - We do not know whether this model actually represents the real world. However, it is consistent with the real world and does allow theories to be tested for consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadrons are nucleons, mesons and glueballs. Nucleons are protons and neutrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you spin a nucleon, the energy increases in proportion to the angular momentum, but in steps. An electron cannot be spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnergetic nucleons are stringlike objects, made up of quarks and gluons. The simplest hadron is a meson, composed of a quark, an anti-quark joined by a stringlike gluon. Open strings, such as mesons, have ends, but there can also be closed strings. Nucleons are 3 quarks joined by a Y shaped string. Another hadron, the closed string or glueball, has no quarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mathematical theory of quarks and gluons is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks are elementary particles with six flavors - up, down, strange, charmed, bottom and top. All quarks come in three colours - blue, green and red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGluons have positive and negative poles, and each has a color - R, B or G. Therefore, nine types of gluon are possible. The propagator of a gluon has two sides corresponding to the two poles - each side is R, B or G. At a vertex, or split, each side must be consistent - e.g. a BR can split into BG - GR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile string theory applied to hadrons is well accepted, fundamental strings associated with gravity at Plank scales are not. The graviton is the primary fundamental string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrical and gravitational forces create waves. Hence, gravitational waves. Gravitons are conjecture. Any particle can emit a graviton, even other gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly, fundamental and QCD strings are the same objects at different scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamental strings require 9 dimensions. The 6 extra dimensions are compacted into geometric spaces called Calabi Yau Manifolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyman theorized that electrical force is due to particles continually emitting and absorbing photons - photon exchange. Also, all matter continually emits and absorbs gravitons. Fundamental strings spawn off and absorb tiny strings - these are the gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe string theory of gravity is not fully described but appears to be the best mathematical model of quantum gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20 - As things slow down, more structure comes into view. Much structure cannot be seen due to cosmic jitter. Perhaps particles are much larger than thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21 - Going up the mass scale beyond elementary particles, are conjectural collections called superpartners, grand unification partners and string excitations. These range to the Planck mass. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) should see superpartners. T\u0026rsquo; Hooft speculates that the spectrum of particles extends beyond the Planck mass in the form of black holes. A 1 kg BH is a trillion times smaller than a proton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings, such as those making up photons, have temperature and entropy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entropy of a BH is proportional to the area of the horizon, and therefore the square of the mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings can cross each other, normally passing through each other. A small probability (the string coupling constant) exists that they split and re-arrange. This is how small strings are formed at a horizon, producing Hawking radiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an electron is dropped into a BH, it becomes charged. A charge on a BH pushes the horizon out from the singularity. If enough charge exists to balance the graviton, you have an extremal BH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolchinski discovered D-branes, a membrane on which fundamental strings can end. These turn out to fill a large mathematical hole in String Theory. The use of D-5 branes for the extra dimensions, D-1 branes for the normal dimensions, and fundamental strings allowed the math to be developed for an extremal BH showing that the entropy = one quarter of the horizon area. Also allowed the math of the evaporation process to be developed. This clinched the argument that BH are storage containers for information, not eaters of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22 - De Sitter space is a four dimensional (4 + 1) space with positive curvature that satisfies Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equations. It is becoming important in cosmology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti De Sitter (ADS) space is similar, but with negative curvature. The space time curvature in ADS creates a gravitational field that pulls objects back to the center even if there is nothing there. If matter is added to an ADS space, a BH trapped in the space (like a box) results - a BTZ black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings on a stack of D-branes are governed by the same rules as those that govern gluons in QCD. Maldacena showed that a three dimensional world with gravity is equivalent to a two dimensional quantum hologram on the boundary of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitten showed that a BH in ADS must be equivalent to something on the surface bounding the the space - a hot fluid of gluons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23 - The Holographic Principle states that everything that takes place in ADS (4+1) is describable by a mathematical theory with fewer dimensions. Quantum gravity in ADS is mathematically equivalent to QCD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an ADS space is modified to a Q space with both a UV (small scale) brane and an IR (large scale) brane, particles near the UV brane act like fundamental strings while those near the IR brane act like nuclear particles. The possibility is that fundamental particles and nuclear particles are really the same objects in different areas of space. The hot quark soup produced in nuclear collision events has an unexpected very low viscosity, as does a BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuclear physics may allow String Theory to be tested. Conversely, String Theory may be applicable to nuclear evenets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24 - It appears that the cosmological constant is non zero - 10 exp -123 in Planck units. Einstein had originally included an extra term in his equations, called the cosmological term. The constant (Greek lambda) creates a repulsive force if negative; attractive if positive. Eventually, Einstein set it to zero, eliminating it from his equations, and calling it his biggest mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cosmic horizon exists at 15 billion light years where the universe is receding from earth at the speed of light. This cosmic horizon may be analagous to BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91pPavXJjkL._AC_UF350,350_QL50_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/todo/the-black-hole-war/","title":"The Black Hole War"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNon puoi prevedere i grandi eventi inattesi, ma proverai a spiegarli a posteriori.

Ritorna una lista di valori unici, richiede una tabella o una lista di colonne, non può essere un espressione; se lo usi con piu di una colonna mostrerà tutte le combinazioni esistenti nei dati.

VALUES ritorna i valori distinti VISIBILI, quindi relativi ai filtri attivi, e lo stesso fa DISTINCT, ma hanno un’approccio diverso in caso di relazioni invalide. Suggerisco di vedere l’esempio, molto chiaro: se per esempio un prodotto manca dalla tabella, i Sales avranno alcuni valori BLANK. DISTINCT fa confusione nel calcolo dell’amount medio per prodotto, mentre VALUES lo considera correttamente nella divisione. Thumb rule mia: meglio usare VALUES dato che è ovunque nel libro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreve approfondimento su HASONEVALUE, che è una shortcut per  IF ( COUNTROWS ( VALUES ( [colonna] ) ) = 1, VALUES ( [colonna] ), e ha un secondo argomento per ritornare qualche messaggio se c’è piu di un valore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4--understanding-evaluation-context\"\u003e4 ⚠ Understanding Evaluation Context\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCi sono due contesti completamente differenti: filter context, che FILTRA DATI e row context, che ITERA TABELLE. Un contesto è l’ambiente in cui l’espressione viene valutata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filter-context\"\u003eFilter Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon riesco a spiegarlo bene quanto l’esempio nel capitolo, ma la mia interpretazione è: qualsiasi formula viene interpretata in base alla cella, che a sua volta esiste in base ai filtri e alle colonne che abbiamo inserito. Quindi TotalSales = SUMX(Sales[Amount] sarà 30mln se la metto in una card senza filtri, magari 1mln se seleziono solo Australia, o 30k in una tabella che divide per brand, ma è sempre la stessa cosa! Quello che conta è il contesto della cella che la esegue. Che è appunto il filter context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"row-context\"\u003eRow Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’esempio usa la colonna calcolata, che ricorda, ragiona riga per riga e agisce durante il data refresh, come Sales[Gross Margin] = Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ). Come fa DAX a capire quale riga sta iterando? Utilizzando il Row Context, che è sostanzialmente un cursore.\nSe scrivi Gross Margin come una misura, perdi il row context della CC, quindi serve un iteratore con X; Gross Margin := SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) )  funziona perchè usa l’iteratore SUMX che sa come tenere il contesto! Invece Gross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) è invalida\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"altre-note\"\u003eAltre note\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Prosegue con molti esempi interessanti delle difficoltà nel capire i due contesti, specialmente nei filtri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn caso di complesse funzioni che iterano in due contesti diversi, esiste la funzione EARLIER per considerare il layer più esterno. Sinceramente spero di non doverla usare, è decisamene tricky, lascio l’esempio nel libro per capire come funziona lo switch. Corrisponde in un certo modo al super() di Python. Il libro stesso dice che è meglio usare le variabili.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicordarsi che il row context itera una singola tabella, non filtra, e perciò non può usare le relazioni senza un RELATED/RELATEDTABLE. Invece un filter context usa le relazioni automaticamente, e si comporta diversamente a seconda della direzione (singola o both, vedi capitolo 15).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolto interessante l’esempio col SUMMARIZE nel caso del calcolo dell’età media dei clienti, senza considerare i doppioni: Il codice fa vedere come includere una colonna diversa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCALCULATE è la funzione più potente e importante di DAX e quella con più sfaccettature da scoprire. CALCULATETABLE è uguale ma restituisce una tabella. La loro complessità è data dal fatto che sono le uniche a creare nuovi filtri, e quindi modificare i filter context del capitolo 4. Anche qua, gli autori raccomandano di rileggere bene bene bene il capitolo e prestare attenzione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa formula è CALCULATE ( Expression, Condition1, \u0026hellip; ConditionN ), accettando qualsiasi espressione come primo parametro obbligatorio, e poi n filtri. Per i filtri, che sono delle tabelle/liste di valori, puoi usare un espressione \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso” che equivale a FILTER ( ALL ( \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] ), \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso\u0026rdquo; ). Per leggibilità, tendi a usare la versione compatta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn breve, CALCULATE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFa una copia del filter context esistente\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eValuta ciascun filtro nei sui args, e, per ciascuna condizione, produce una lista di valori validi per la colonna specifica (nell’esempio, sarà {’Contoso’}). Equivale a un FILTER ALL (ricorda!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSe due o più filtri riguardano la stessa colonna, verranno uniti con un AND statement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsa la nuova condizione per sostituire i filtri esistenti o aggiungendoli al contesto se non ve ne sono presenti.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(VEDI GIU) Se c’è un row context, applica una Context Transition trasformandolo in un filter context e rimuovendo quello esistente\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuando ha finito, applica il nuovo filter context al modello, e una volta calcolato ritorna al contesto originario. Non è quindi una modifica permanente\nMolto importante: dato che CALCULATE usa un FILTER ( ALL) dietro le quinte, se vuoi evitare che tolga tutti i filtri dovrai usare la forma estesa della condizione, e utilizzare VALUES se vuoi mantenere i filtri correnti di altre tabelle, per esempio. Interessante il caso che mostra nel capitolo con un Ratio in relazione alla tabella Sales filtrata, mentre quella Date deve mantenere i filtri.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filtrare-con-condizioni-complesse\"\u003eFiltrare con condizioni complesse\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC’è un esempio con uno slicer che prova a filtrare una CALCULATE, ma ovviamente dato che usa ALL nella versione compatta viene ignorato!

It automatically adds as filter arguments all the columns that are currently being iterated in any row context—filtering their actual value in the row being iterated\nIn soldoni, il CALCULATE utilizza il row context come FILTRO nel FILTER CONTEXT, dato che in sè non è un iterable. Questa è una transizione.\nOttimo esempio per ripassare il contesto. La formula Sum Num Of Sales := SUMX ( Sales, COUNTROWS ( Sales ) ), sorprendentemente, ritorna il COUNTROWS al Quadrato; infatti il # righe di Contoso è 37000, per esempio, e SUMX itera 37000 volte per ciascuna riga, quindi darà 37000*37000 dato che sta ragionando col row context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltro esempio: Sales Amount := SUMX ( Sales, CALCULATE ( SUM ( Sales[Quantity]))). Il segreto è che dietro le quinte CALCULATE sta creando dei filtri riga per riga dato che segue il row context nel SUMX, quindi farà Tot = CALCULATE(SUM ( Sales[Quantity] ), Sales[Product] = “A”)  + CALCULATE(SUM ( Sales[Quantity] ), Sales[Product] = “B”)\u0026hellip; eccetera per n volte\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa context transition (CT) è COSTOSA. Usa calculate parsimoniosamente, perchè nelle iterazioni applicherà il filtro per ciascuna riga\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT non filtra solo una riga, come potresti pensare. Il nuovo filtro transizionato filtra tutte le righe con lo stesso valore. Quindi se nell’esempio sopra abbiamo  Sales[Product] = “A”, potrebbero esserci piu di un risultato a seconda dei dati in input\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT usa colonne non presenti nella formula.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT crea un filter context a partire da un row context.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT avviene quando c’è un row context (quindi negli iteratori e nelle colonne calcolate).

I peggiori competitor di una specie (in sopravvivenza) è la specie stessa. Potremmo fare qualcosa per Prestigio (attori) o Dominanza (dittatori), e mandiamo segnali impliciti e esplicit con i nostri atteggniamenti.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNorme: abbiamo delle norme da rispettare, e spesso le manteniamo con concetti come gossip e reputazione. Devi rispettare le regole del tuo gruppo sociale o rischi l’ostracizzazione\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBarare: con la giusta scusa non ci facciamo problemi a barare; un segreto puo essere di pubblico dominio finchè nessuno lo sdogana (e.g. il vestito dell’imperatore e sacchetti di carta a NY)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutoinganno: concetto interessante, in breve le persone che performano meglio sono quello che si impongono da soli cose a cui credere (vedi soldati). O meglio, convinci l’avversario a credere a qualcosa. Ci sono 4 archetipi: Madman → Nixon che fa il pazzo per convincere gli altri a trattare, Loyalist → “Sure I’ll go along with your beliefs”, Cheerleader → Propaganda, tipo startup founder che è forzatamente ottimista e Cheater → che si mente da solo forzatamente perchè sa che è la soluzione migliore.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContraffazione: ci sono due emisferi, destro e sinistro.

Negano che non sappi cosa faccia l’altro emisfero. In molti casi facciamo lo stesso, il nostro lavoro non è avere decisioni, ma motivarle!

Il famoso “scherzo eh”. Devo tenerlo d’occhio che non bisogna confondere l’altro con questa cosa\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConversazioni: non trattare le conversazioni come un semplice scambio di info: io e tu dai a me in cambio.

Ma non funziona come una trattativa commerciale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConsumo: questo è un po vago, comunque parla della rat race su cui non dobbiamo cascare, dato che il nostro status sociale non deve finire nel flex e nello showing off, non serve. Puntiamo sul patrimonio invece delle cose sfuggenti, empiriche. è difficile perchè nella società moderna giudichiamo le persone per quello che hanno, non per quello che sono\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Arte: questo interessante. L’arte ha una funzione di mostrare quanto tempo libero e energia abbiamo per creare qualcosa di apparentemente inutile (fin dai cavernicoli con le pitture). Infatti disegniamo le repliche, e se scopriamo che un opera d’arte è una foto perde molto di valore! Noi apprezziamo l’arte per lo sbatti che si è preso l’artista nel consegnarcela.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Benficenza: anche la beneficenza nasconde secondi fini. Una grossa parte dei benefattori non controlla dove finiscono i suoi soldi e se la compagnia no-profit li usa in modo efficiente. Anzi, quando hanno provate ad analizzare il ROB si sono indignati. Questo è un controsenso, se ci fregasse vorremmo sapere se vengono usati bene i soldi. Questo perchè 1. lo vediamo come una cosa lontana, ergo frega poco, e 2. lo facciamo per far sapere al mondo che siamo buoni (o le donazioni sarebbero anonime)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEducazione: se i top college volessero aiutare piu studenti, allargherebbero i posti. Ma costano di piu perchè sono limitati, non perchè c’è un educazione migliore (ma miglior network, vedi statistiche). Peraltro a scuola ti insegnano ad adattarti ed essere misurato, blah blah\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Medicina: imbottirci di medicina e andare dal medico per ogni cosa è un classico modo per far vedere che ci stiamo sforzando per la nostra salute e che siamo intervenuti… Medicina è una forma elaborata di bacino sulla bua. Vari studi che spendere di piu non comporta miglior probabilità di sopravvivere, ma sfortunatamente non ragioniamo cosi quando stiamo male, vogliamo il meglio e subito. Se vogliamo vivere a lungo sarebbe meglio non fumare, bere, mangiare sano, fare ginnastica, etc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReligione: piu che la religione in se la gente è accomunata da quello in cui crede, nei riti e le norme della propria comunità. è piu un sistema sociale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePolitica: i votanti non votano per interesse personale (tanto varebbe poco il voto singolo) ma come segnale per mostrare appoggio a una causa in cui credono (destra/sinistra).

alt=\"image\"\u003e\nI said earlier that the CEO sent back many of my attempts to get this work done. Really, she rejected two things. The rst was an underdeveloped strategic plan that was almost entirely about system and architectural details and lacked very few forward-thinking ideas beyond the next 6 to 12 months.

Usa union: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGli aspy sono avantaggiati: non sono sensibili alle social clues, quindi pensano fuori dagli schemi e non seguono la massa, per le loro idee!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOgni startup deve iniziare con un piccolo mercato, da dominare. E.g. Amazon dominava i libri online. Se pensi che il tuo mercato sia troppo grande, lo e’ di sicuro\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFiloseggiata su pessimismo/ottimismo definito/indefinito. Dice che gli US sono inguaribili ottimisti, e fa bene per buttarsi, e ultimamente conta quello indefinito. Sapere che un giorno le cose saranno meglio, e piu facili, ti fa creare e sperimentare. Non sai quando, non sai che piano, allora vai alla cieca e velocemente\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI VC sanno che la maggior parte delle sue companies falliranno. Devono solo trovare quella che fa 100x, quindi puntano solo in grande.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRipensandoci, e’ un lavoraccio. Se non centri la nuova Uber, di solito fallisce il fondo!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvere il 0.01% di Google, per esempio, e’ molto di valore. Quindi fai piccoli investimenti in tante cose\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCerca i segreti: ricorda sempre: quale verita’ tutti danno per scontata? Aggirala, trova un segreto, lavoraci. In molti casi, tipo nel medicale, questi segreti escono se ti addentri molto e investi molto. Non e’ facile\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUna startup che inizia male e’ irrecuperabile. Servono solide fondamenta!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCit che non mi piace ma capisco: chi e’ coinvolto, deve lavorare full time. Serve massima aderenza, no remote, no part time, no consultants\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eE.g. in Paypal erano tutti ossessionati dal creare una currency digitale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSenza una mission, un segreto, non attirerai i migliori nella tua startup. E’ un arte, troverai la tua\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParadossalmente, a PayPal molti erano simili, e questo gli ha fatto iniziare molto velocemente dato che erano d’accordo su moltissime cose. Mhhh, questo clasha con altri libri, penso dipenda dal contesto.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeve essere tipo una tribu: meno di un culto, ma poooco meno (mah)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI programmatori hanno il problema di pensare che dato che hanno costruito una cosa cool, allora gliela compreranno tutti. No. Ti serve vendere (e venderti!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTutti i sales sono in un certo senso attori. Ma noi reagiamo male a quelli che lavorano male. I bravi salesman ti convincono.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA seconda del prezzo del tuo prodotto (molto costoso → poche vendite → piu importanti i sales che lavorino il cliente)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAltro errore dei programmatori (qua chiamati nerd): non fidarsi dei media. Troppo media non va bene, ma vendersi vuol dire anche esporsi ai media!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLook around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnology non sostituira’ gli umani: sara’ complementare, come e’ sempre stato\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e7 Domande da farsi per una startup di successo:\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe People Question Do you have the right team?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?

Bella analisi sulle cleantech, che non hanno previsto cose come la 1. , 5. , 6.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTip: nel loro fondo, rifiutavano CEO in cravatta. Quelli che creano e si sporcano le mani hanno jeans e maglietta, gli altri sono solo Sales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI founder sono importanti. Non sottostimare quanto puo spingere e cambiare una singola persona!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zGCdRQXOL._SL1200_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/todo/zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-how-to-build-the-future/","title":"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future"}]
