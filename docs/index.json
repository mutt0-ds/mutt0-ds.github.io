[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eToday I want to share an interesting challenge that\u0026rsquo;s been bugging me since I joined InvestSuite last December.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s stories like this that makes me happy to be a developer, being able to address things that are ruining my day and get rid of them. It feels so satisfying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe work with massive JSON files (deeply nested, sprawling structures), and we needed a way to test them reliably.\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe stability of \u003ca href=\"https://www.investsuite.com/storyteller\"\u003eStoryTeller\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, our personalized report engine, depended on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me give you some context first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-storyteller-works\"\u003eHow StoryTeller works\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tool, simply said, generates hyper-personalized financial reports.\nEvery word in them is tailored, whether it\u0026rsquo;s referencing a customer\u0026rsquo;s name or how their portfolio performed in the past months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the most “rigid” version of StoryTeller, we define \u003cstrong\u003ea logic tree\u003c/strong\u003e to compose each sentence. Think of it like a massive if-else chain: dozens of nested conditions that cover every possible scenario. For each one, we have pre-approved text to use in the final report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 3002px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 58.0336%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/MR89MoAX?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor example here, each section is built based on several factors. The first 3 words \u003ccode\u003eThis excellent quarter\u003c/code\u003e depends on the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s performance (very good) and the reporting period type (quarter).\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy so strict? \u003cstrong\u003eCompliance\u003c/strong\u003e. Every line that may appear in the report must be approved in advance by customer\u0026rsquo;s legal team. That means we need a full database of all possible variations, and the logic to match each one correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the catch:\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis tree has to cover EVERYTHING.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portfolio can go up, down, or stay flat. A quarter can be Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4. Every combination matters, and conditions often reference each other, so the number of possibilities explodes in the more advanced parts of the report. Miss just one, and Storyteller will crash because there\u0026rsquo;s no corresponding text. We call this \u003cem\u003ea missing scenario\u003c/em\u003e and it was my worst nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the logic file grows to 100k lines with 12+ intertwined conditions, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully easy to miss something obscure.\nMaybe a combo that never happens, until it does, and weeks later you\u0026rsquo;re frantically searching for that missing scenario to fix it on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-struggles\"\u003eMy struggles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom day one, I was thinking: how do we make this system more stable? It was driving me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, \u003cstrong\u003ethe text database was responsible for ~70% of our bugs\u003c/strong\u003e. A customer tested a bunch of reports, and many of them crashed because of missing text scenarios. I spent days navigating these giant files. They are so big that not even Gitlab diff view are displaying the changes between versions, you need to scroll through each JSON line and write down the scenarios and find what\u0026rsquo;s missing. My eyes were burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 2179px\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 44.3282%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/AwRnI1ns?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, 75k, sometimes even 100k+ lines. Imagine scrolling through that monster of a JSON file, hunting for a single missing piece.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the logic of the text database was not always clear to developers, because it was implemented by copywriters who know how to tell \u0026ldquo;the story\u0026rdquo; and are creating the scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe never had the certainty that everything was covered. We had already implemented a bunch of stability patches, but testing these trees was still a nightmare.\nOr was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"first-idea-brute-force-it\"\u003eFirst idea: brute-force it\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first idea was to just \u003cstrong\u003etry all the scenarios\u003c/strong\u003e. Loop through every combo of inputs and let the tool crash if something\u0026rsquo;s missing. Makes sense, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I created a script that isolates that part of the code, loads a random value for each conditions (e.g. a performance can be \u0026gt;0, 0 or \u0026lt;0, a quarter can be Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, etc\u0026hellip;) and tries every single combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProblem: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale. The combinations grow exponentially: hundreds of millions of possibilities. Each test might be fast, but running all of them was not feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 480px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 42.5%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/fwInkazj?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot going to share my terrible code here 😇\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my PM said something that shifted my thinking.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need to run every case: we just need to \u003cstrong\u003esee\u003c/strong\u003e the logic clearly enough to spot problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"second-idea-use-miro-to-easily-visualize-the-tree\"\u003eSecond idea: use Miro to easily visualize the tree\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the insight.\nOur copywriters already use whiteboard tools like \u003ca href=\"https://miro.com/\"\u003eMiro\u003c/a\u003e to brainstorm logic trees visually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why not just bring that into our testing process? If we can compare the visual tree with the JSON structure, we could catch inconsistencies before they break production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003cstrong\u003ea mind map (like Miro), you can spot missing branches easily\u003c/strong\u003e. You can collapse nodes, focus on one part of the tree, and review logic visually. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, and human errors can still happen, but it makes everything reviewable. You isolate the problem from thousands of JSON lines to a simpler graph, way more manageable, even for non-technical people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I gave it a shot. I set up a Miro project, wrote a script to export their mind maps in a JSON-compatible format using their API, and added some lightweight tests. It was quite fun: I re-created the scenarios as nodes in Miro, ran the script, and the tool was comparing expectation, suggesting missing cases, and even highlight similar-looking logic paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 2060px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 54.1642%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/wvMIEC5f?theme=dark\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked great for a prototype.\nBut once the node count grew, \u003cstrong\u003eMiro became unusable and slow\u003c/strong\u003e, and the experience worsened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest problems is that the search and replace feature hanged, making it unusable (we have dozens of trees, one for each part of the element) and when I had to create a new one there was no smart copy-paste (either grab a whole tree or nothing).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started using several Miro files to be able to open them but this was getting out of hand.

I remember our instructor showing us funny videos of different cultures interacting. There was an American asking an Indian colleague if they\u0026rsquo;ll meet next week\u0026rsquo;s deadline. The response, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e could mean either \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;sure\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;no way\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e depending on the cultural context. Needless to add that the American was very confused when the deadline wasn\u0026rsquo;t met the week after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because India is a high-context culture, where linguistic nuances are the norm. An Indian person won\u0026rsquo;t give us negative feedback directly. Instead, they use varying levels of complex analogies to provide indirect hints on how to improve. Compare this to a low-context Swedish person. He will be more likely to say \u0026ldquo;This system sucks\u0026rdquo; in a blunt and direct way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer on generalizations: It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that we\u0026rsquo;re discussing averages and general tendencies, not stereotypes.

In China, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to know the other person, share meals and drinks together. At the opposite, Nordic cultures like America and Germany prefer to focus on tasks. From both perspectives, their approach feels natural, but it\u0026rsquo;s deeply ingrained in their cultural norms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"and-thats-great\"\u003eAnd that’s great!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the fun part: \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0026rsquo;re all different\u003c/strong\u003e, and there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; way to communicate.

I was able to connect more naturally and avoid many intercultural oopsie.\nKnowing cultures serves as a shortcut: if I\u0026rsquo;m talking with someone from a low-context culture, I can expect some sharp and direct comments. For a high-context culture, I need to be very careful and read between the lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s take time perception as another example.

It takes less energy to be nice to everyone than to figure out who you need to be nice to. So, looking at all the people in the room in the eye, one by one, slowly, will have several benefits.

Being a good listener is ranked as the number one skill for a top leader. Eye contact, taking notes, asking probing questions, and even the standard \u0026ldquo;mhh mhh\u0026rdquo; are all body language cues of someone interested in the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut listening is not only for others; it\u0026rsquo;s also for you. \u003cstrong\u003eBy listening, and generally asking things, you gather information you didn\u0026rsquo;t even know you didn\u0026rsquo;t know\u003c/strong\u003e, which is, like, the point of meeting people. To achieve this, leverage open-ended questions like \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rdquo; that prompt the other person to reflect and give a complex response, or closed-ended questions that require just a yes/no and provide a precise response. Usually, using closed-ended questions is a closing technique in sales situations, but be cautious not to self-censor with questions like \u0026ldquo;Any other challenges with this issue?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s easy for someone to just say no.

Don\u0026rsquo;t talk during that arc. All sound is delivered to a pair of eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has the benefit of maintaining power by coming across as comfortable with pauses, giving the audience time to digest what you have said, and then delivering your most important information with impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePay attention to your posture: Use gestures to directly point to your points, and stand with your back parallel to the back wall of the room to keep all attention on the audience. Keep your feet planted in one spot; only pros walk around the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout slides: The trick Sullivan suggests is to read what\u0026rsquo;s on the slide to the audience, and then add what\u0026rsquo;s not on each point. If it\u0026rsquo;s a list of three bullet points, use the Arc of Silence, read each point, add more context, go to the second point, add second context, and so on. You need to cover everything, and keep all the points simple. Reading every word on the slide is usually a bad sign, but if you do it like this, you will fix everything in the memory of the audience as they have two inputs: voice and visual, saying the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing your slide deck can be challenging: opt for a streamlined presentation and provide a more detailed slide deck as a handout afterward. You can\u0026rsquo;t have a highly detailed document and a compelling presentation simultaneously; it\u0026rsquo;s essential to separate the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"7-responding-to-questions-\"\u003e7.

Numbers encourage participants to keep going\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProhibit criticism, as it may stop other ideas from flowing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse wall space, ideally with a big panel, to display all the results of the session\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLimit the session to 1 hour; after that, the quality of ideas tends to decrease significantly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTranscribe ideas and distribute them quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"-section-5-your-leadership\"\u003e🦸‍♂️ Section 5: Your Leadership\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"18-leading-others\"\u003e18. Leading Others\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is regarding the next stage of your career, where you lead your people. Many managers have their own plan and framework, and all of them are fine since they worked from them. But what \u003cstrong\u003eyou absolutely need is a group of followers\u003c/strong\u003e\nWithout other opeople, you only have nothign b ut potential. Leadership is, in the end, the ability to connect with them inspire them, guide them. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not about you. You have to communicate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour values: define them. Whether your statement of values focuses on integrity or courage or street smarts or anything else, you must phrase your values about others. Reframe to the audience\u0026rsquo;s perspective, e.g. \u0026ldquo;I believe in work-life balance\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;you deserve a healthy balance and to see your kids on more than just the weekend\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour vision: broarder than a set of actions, bur more concrete of a vague statement of ideas. Sullivan mentions the \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/smart-goals/#:~:text=This%20framework%20can%20be%20helpful,they%20can%20help%20your%20team.\"\u003eSMART framework\u003c/a\u003e to evaluate your goal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour plan: how will your reach your goal?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour actions: as a leader, what you will do will heavily influence the others. You have to give a good example to have others follow you, as they compare the words you said with what you ewffectively do\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"19-showing-vulnerability\"\u003e19. Showing Vulnerability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo lead, we must instill confidence in others, which comes from an inner sense of self-respect and self-awareness. And \u003cstrong\u003epart of this confidens comes from showing your genuine self\u003c/strong\u003e, which may admit to failures, embrace chance, show anxieties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often fear being exposed, but the reality is, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about that—we already are. No one expects us to be perfect, especially not those we work closely with. It\u0026rsquo;s liberating to admit when we\u0026rsquo;re wrong or unsure about something. Another common fear is rejection: however, the more people understand the authentic you, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll see that you\u0026rsquo;re not fundamentally different from them as a whole person. When others genuinely know who you are, rejection becomes less likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/simply_said/cover.png","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2024/07/personal-notes-simply-said/","title":"Personal Notes about Simply Said"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eIn recent months, I have been experimenting with AI tools to leverage new, powerful technologies and create value. Like you, I am inundated with hype and buzzwords, and this makes things complicate, when trying to get started. While looking for simple answers to my questions, it’s often challenging to extract real value. So, I want to share my notes to help others with similar needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-business-case-an-ai-analyst\"\u003eMy Business Case: an AI Analyst\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with the big question I had in my mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a big, complex data source (a database, an API). How can I connect it to an AI and be fairly* confident it doesn’t mess things up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Remember, with AI, you can’t be 100% sure of anything.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I worked with our order database to create an “AI Analyst\u0026quot; using Azure OpenAI. The goal was to enable it to respond to common questions like, \u003cem\u003e“When is my order arriving?”\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e“What’s the order status for this customer?”\u003c/em\u003e This would save our analysts time and effort since the majority of the questions they receive are always the same..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not talking of the toy databases you find in tutorials with 3 tables and 10 columns, this is a real schema with joins, millions of rows and knowledge of the business logic required. The cool part is that by using tools the AI model won’t care about the complexity underneath: as you’ll see, the possibilities are endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-ai-tools\"\u003eBefore AI Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the “old days” (five months ago, lol), the only way was to use GPT-3.5 to make SQL queries and return a response, specifically with Langchain and a \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/use_cases/sql/\"\u003eSQL\u003c/a\u003e plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also considered making DAX queries to \u003ca href=\"https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/powerbi/\"\u003ePower BI\u003c/a\u003e models. However, AI tends to hallucinate when you add a couple of joins in SQL, and it gets even worse with a language that has only a fraction of the documentation and popularity. Indeed, results were terrible. I remember using several calls for checking and parsing the code, along with multiple retries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-game-changer-tools\"\u003eThe Game Changer: Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, \u003ca href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling\"\u003eOpenAI announced Tools (initially called Function Calling)\u003c/a\u003e. Tools allow the latest AI models (3.5 turbo, 4, 4o) to decide whether calling certain functions when needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like telling to our GPT, \u003ccode\u003e“Reply to my {QUESTION}, knowing that if I ask about the weather, you can use this {FUNCTION} which needs the city and time as input.”\u003c/code\u003e. This is prompt engineering, as I was saying. The OpenAI ChatCompletion API returns a special object for running the tool and then provides the final response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis differs from \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\"\u003eRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\u003c/a\u003e, where you use a specialized Vector database to search your documents (e.g., Copilot with your email inbox), then pass the best results to the prompt and tell the AI to reply based on the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"max-width: 1536px; margin-bottom:3%\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"//iframely.net/ZRkGzjC\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e different.

However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale well with larger datasets, and manual refreshes are necessary for obtaining the freshest data. It\u0026rsquo;s suitable for small-scale projects but falls short when dealing with larger datasets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"directquery\"\u003eDirectQuery\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery\"\u003eDirectQuery\u003c/a\u003e is interesting.\nThe report\u0026rsquo;s semantic model is just a connector to the original data source (in this case, a database), and every time you interact with your report sends a new query.

The concept is straightforward yet ingenious: one report to serve them all.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works: we import all the data into a report, then publish it in a shared Power BI workspace accessible to users. Daily (and hourly) ETL pipelines handle refreshing the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; report automatically, overseen by data engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this setup, users can \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;live connect\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e to the report and enjoy all the benefits of Import Mode—size, speed, and simplicity—without worrying about refreshing the semantic model, which resides elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a significant drawback is the inability to modify the semantic model directly since it\u0026rsquo;s located elsewhere. Thus, creating new tables and columns (excluding measures) in a live connected report isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. All new changes must be made in the original report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"composite-model\"\u003eComposite Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-composite-models\"\u003eComposite Model\u003c/a\u003e is when you mix together a Live Connection (which becomes a DirectQuery), and something else, either another DirectQuery or a local file in Import Mode.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go too much into details here because it\u0026rsquo;s a new feature, and still has big limitations in my opinion. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned its great potential in a past article, as it can be the Saint Graal for some people who aim to integrate an \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; report with their own local files, but mixing together connection can incredibly deteriorate the query performance, because the model will make several queries before joining the results with the rest of the data. Still, be very cautious with composite models and keep an eye for future updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Composite Model blends a Live Connection (which essentially becomes a DirectQuery) with another DirectQuery or a local file in Import Mode. I won\u0026rsquo;t delve too deeply into the specifics here because it\u0026rsquo;s a relatively new feature with significant limitations, in my opinion. While I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted its potential \u003ca href=\"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/03/what-power-bi-is-missing/\"\u003ein a previous article\u003c/a\u003e, caution is warranted, as mixing connections can severely impact query performance.

This approach combines the speed of Import mode with the live queries of DirectQuery by utilizing well-optimized tables in a Data Lake, offering the best of both worlds.

These tidbits pique my interest or hint at something important, even though I may not fully grasp their significance at the time. They range from random tickets I stumble upon to snippets from meetings, archived documents, scripts or casual coffee chat exchanges. Later, typically at the end of my day when tackling a substantial task isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal, I revisit these notes to organize them properly, adding relationships and moving them in the apposite subfolders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother engaging activity involves exploring the note tree. I enjoy clicking through the dots and uncovering unconnected notes (\u0026ldquo;orphans\u0026rdquo;), re-reading them, and establishing fresh connections or cleaning up outdated entries.

Since the Obsidian vault is just an extensive markdown repository, I\u0026rsquo;ve considered automation possibilities such as generating notes automatically when we receive new tickets, complete with metadata. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on an experimental script to extract text using OCR from PowerPoint and Word files, transforming them into Markdown format through the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Unstructured-IO\"\u003eUnstructured\u003c/a\u003e Python library.

Consequently, Meta\u0026rsquo;s social media platform decided to temporarily remove the option of adding music to posts.

Thus, organizing my information, tasks, and notes is a key activity in my work (and personal) life. Without a clear system, I would feel lost in chaos, and my productivity would plunge (also considering that my memory sucks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I want to introduce you to two buzzwords related to the note taking: \u003cstrong\u003eBrain Dumping\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSecond Brain\u003c/strong\u003e. Brain Dumping is a technique that involves storing as quick as possible any useful data in a safe place, so it can be easily accessed and cleaned later and the brain can avoid worrying about them. For example, if you have a code snippet that helped you solve a problem, you can copy and paste it into a note in your \u0026ldquo;_TO_ORGANIZE\u0026rdquo; folder.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m free, usually at the end of the day, I cleanse the note, add some context to the code, and put them in the right section of my documentation tool. Some old-schoolers use post-it notes and agendas, I use Second Brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we\u0026rsquo;ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.\n\u0026ndash; \u003ccite\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/\"\u003eTiago Forte \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept has given rise to tools like which are strucuted to help take note-taking to the next level.\nThese tools, structured like wikis, extend the concept of Brain Dumping by making taking notes, connecting and structuring them a bliss, or in my special case, even a \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; activity. The biggest players are \u003ca href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\"\u003eRoam Research\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"\u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e, all with different characteristics but sharing the same core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I love using Notion for my personal Second Brain because of its user-friendly UX. You may already know my deep love for Notion , which I use on my daily life and I contribute to the Python library. For starters, I recommend it thanks to its user-friendly UX, and it\u0026rsquo;s the go-to choice for my personal Second Brain. Sometimes I give access to part of my Notion wiki to other people and they immediately catch up with its structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for work, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that Obsidian is the way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/notes.png\" alt=\"notes\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-at-work\"\u003e💼 Obsidian at work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Notion stores data on their servers without a self-hosted option and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work offline, so putting sensitive data in there is out of question. Obsidian, differently, works completely offline (so unless you pay for a Premium service or use a shared directory you can\u0026rsquo;t access its notes from other devices). Its notes are \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; Markdown files (a special textual format with a specific syntax for basic customization) stored in the PC, just like .txt documents\u0026hellip; And the program reads them like Notepad, super minimal and lightweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Obsidian notes have a singular characteristic that makes them particularly suitable in my current environment\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are like neurons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put it plainly, Obsidian is literally a second brain. Notes don\u0026rsquo;t have to be structured in a folder and can be interconnected with hyperlinks, which creates an out-of-world experience for exploring and finding new relationships. And all it takes is mentioning the other file between brackets! A picture is worth a thousand words, and here is a typical Obsidian graph view that allows you to visually explore how notes are linked to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/obsidian_graph.png\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_search.gif\" alt=\"graph view 2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-why-i-have-chosen-obsidian\"\u003e☝ Why I have chosen Obsidian\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy job is a constant juggling act of multiple large projects, meetings, tickets, and reports from various data sources. It\u0026rsquo;s a labyrinth of information that\u0026rsquo;s impossible to navigate without getting lost. But then, Obsidian comes to the rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its ability to link notes together, I can map out the entire flow of information and stay on top of everything. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I do it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach meeting is linked to the relevant projects or open tickets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach ticket is linked to the reports and data sources notes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach data source is linked to its business logics and other data sources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach project has documentation and links to all related meetings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach script is linked to the ticket or project it\u0026rsquo;s been useful for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so on, depending on the scenario.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s graph view, I can quickly access all the information connected to a single object. During meetings or whenever I gain new intel, I quickly jot it down using the \u0026ldquo;Brain Dumping\u0026rdquo; strategy and store it in Obsidian. Later, I organize the notes, link them together, and expand the wiki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-a-brief-overview-of-the-structure\"\u003e📁 A brief overview of the structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Obsidian vault is a treasure trove of information that I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to structure in a way that is easy for my colleagues to access. It\u0026rsquo;s a semi-structured schema with high flexiblity as it\u0026rsquo;s not required by Obsidian (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a sort option) that helps to organize the wealth of information that I need to manage every day. With main folders and subfolders, I can easily navigate my way around and find what I need quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a snapshot of my Obsidian vault structure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTO_ORGANIZE\u003c/strong\u003e - this is where I store new notes by default before cleaning them up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDocs\u003c/strong\u003e - where I keep all the important documentation that my team and I need to access quickly.

It\u0026rsquo;s a system that is not only efficient but also visually appealing. I could remove all the folders if I wanted to, but the structure helps to give a familiar feel to other users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-plugins-i-use\"\u003e🔨 Plugins I use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a plethora of options available in the marketplace to enhance the Obsidian experience. While I prefer to keep things streamlined, here are a few plugins that I can wholeheartedly recommend:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003eEditor Syntax Highlight\u003c/a\u003e: exceedingly helpful, especially when dealing with notes containing code snippets. It makes syntax highlighting a breeze, and makes the code much more readable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table\"\u003eExcel to Markdown table\u003c/a\u003e: an absolute lifesaver when you need to copy data from Excel files. It takes care of all the formatting issues, saving you a ton of time and effort.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder\"\u003eIcon Folder\u003c/a\u003e: I love this plugin because it allows me to maintain the same aesthetic I was accustomed to in Notion, where every folder had a corresponding emoji. It\u0026rsquo;s a small touch, but it makes the interface much more enjoyable to use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename\"\u003ePaste Image rename\u003c/a\u003e: If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who frequently pastes screenshots or other images into your notes, then it is an absolute must-have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection\"\u003ePaste URL into selection\u003c/a\u003e: another one that replicates the functionality of Notion, and it\u0026rsquo;s a time-saver for me.

It makes minor typographic tweaks (like replacing hyphens with en-dashes), which makes the notes more visually appealing and easier to read.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jdbrice/obsidian-code-block-copy\"\u003eCopy Button for code blocks\u003c/a\u003e: a tiny addition that saves me a ton of time. It adds a copy button to code blocks, so you can quickly copy the code without having to highlight it and use the keyboard shortcut. I can\u0026rsquo;t understand why this functionality isn\u0026rsquo;t already built into Obsidian.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-obsidian-limitations\"\u003e⛔ Obsidian limitations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, there are some limitations with Obsidian that are impacting my experience. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnfortunately, there is no option to share a note as a public link that can be accessed by others (web or within my organization). While I understand Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s focus on privacy and \u0026ldquo;private notes,\u0026rdquo; I do miss the convenience of being able to easily share a page as a link with a colleague or leave clickable shortcuts to links in a folder like in Notion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe PDF export feature is limited, and there\u0026rsquo;s no way to export notes in bulk. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;d like to automatically upload a PDF of some notes in a folder when I edit them with specific formatting. But unless I start learning \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template\"\u003eLaTeX and pandoc\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m unable to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyntax formatting in code blocks isn\u0026rsquo;t enabled unless you have \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\"\u003ean outdated plugin\u003c/a\u003e that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even support DAX (Power BI\u0026rsquo;s script language) formatting. While I\u0026rsquo;m working on a plugin fork to address this issue, it\u0026rsquo;s a tedious process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile the Obsidian team is currently focused on the \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/canvas\"\u003eCanvas feature\u003c/a\u003e, which is a fantastic addition for those who previously used Graph.io and similar software, the frequency and impact of updates are slow due to the team\u0026rsquo;s small size. Thus, I doubt that my previous issues will be addressed quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, I would strongly advise against using Obsidian if you are not fond of its neural structure, especially if your notes are not often interconnected. This is due to the fact that the learning curve can be steep, requiring the mastery of several shortcuts and a certain discipline in maintaining notes. If you neglect to organize your vault, it can quickly become overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that if you\u0026rsquo;re not utilizing connections, you\u0026rsquo;re only tapping into half of Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-first-results\"\u003e🥳 First Results\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been four months since I started using Obsidian, and it has already been a game-changer for me on multiple occasions. Initially, I was skeptical due to my love for Notion, but the adoption process was seamless, and my productivity has definitively increased. The most incredible thing about Obsidian is how I can instantly look back at past meetings connected to a particular topic and explore further, find connections, and expand my knowledge by examining other notes and reconstructing the entire scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn excellent example that I presented in my proposal was a story about a user who raised a question during a brief meeting about an advanced Power BI feature. During the meeting, I took some notes on the issue, then created another note with a guide, and then another note about the following meeting where I introduced the guide. A few days later, I completely forgot where the guide was located, but I remembered the user\u0026rsquo;s happy reaction in the second-grade related note and traced my way back to the valuable document. I use this technique multiple times a day when searching for notes, and it saves me a lot of time piece by piece. Also, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about restructuring notes when a project evolves; I can just link them together and embed updates of the project in a primary super note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutt0-ds/mutt0-ds.github.io/master/static/images/obsidian/graph_view.gif\" alt=\"graph view\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most significant advantage, as mentioned in the introduction, is the ease of the \u0026ldquo;brain dumping\u0026rdquo; process. Whenever I come across new information, I can open Obsidian in one second, create a note with a shortcut, and jot down a few lines to be cleaned up later. My brain is now free to keep listening and learning without worrying about forgetting anything valuable.

Take inspiration from superheroes, where the origin story always raises interest. When presentation attendees recognize the narrative arc, it helps them understand your material because they understand the basic framework and they can follow it in an easier way.

Embrace the change, the majority of the authors is constantly reworking their presentations after each conference! After presenting, remember the things that didn’t convince the public (ideally, you should find someone with brutal honesty and criticism to tell you) and update your work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤼 \u003cstrong\u003eConcurrent Presentation\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you are creating a group presentation, assign a Slide Wrangler who will handle the Master deck and start using the same template so merging pieces won’t be chaotic. If you want to highlight a “TODO” Slide to be enhanced, you can drift out from the template with the ugliest combination of font/colors to draw attention to the issue.

Inside jokes add credibility as they mark you as an insider. Neal Ford calculates one joke every 15 minutes, but don’t make them Alienating Artifacts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤵 \u003cstrong\u003eLeet Grammars\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is an alternative alphabet (aka slang) that you can use to be perceived as part as the audience, an insider.

It synergies with the Narrative Arc pattern, hovewer use it only once. It can be implicit (an hidden detail) or simply a slide with a question and “Stay tuned!”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🏛 \u003cstrong\u003eGreek Chorus (and Posse)\u003c/strong\u003e\nBring friends to the talk to support you and show positive feedbacks, influencing the other participants.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧩 \u003cstrong\u003eComposite Animations\u003c/strong\u003e\nFor a unique animation effect that catches the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention, layer two or more animations on top of each other. Don’t overdo it, use it for key slides and only if you know well which animations you should use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍽 \u003cstrong\u003eÁ la Carte Content\u003c/strong\u003e\nAt the beginning of the presentation, you can poll the audience to construct their agenda by choosing what they want to hear between small chunks of content (Talklets). This is a very complex strategy as you need to be extremely prepared to the different scenarios and create additional material\u0026hellip; It works well in case of a presentation you need to share several times with groups with different knowledge levels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📻 \u003cstrong\u003eAnalog Noise\u003c/strong\u003e\nPlace unpolished elements in the presentation to make a key message stand out (e.g. an ugly font for the title of a slide introducing a problem). Don’t overuse the tecnique. Stand out from the overly polished and aesthetic presentations we currently have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🚫 \u003cstrong\u003eDefy Defaults\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t follow the default settings, stand out from the typical presentation style, especially corporate ones which are riddled with antipatterns. Don’t go directly against the rules, but try to apply the patterns you have learned in a subtle way\u0026hellip; For example by using the corporate template when you have to, but then showing your style in the body of the presentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⤴ \u003cstrong\u003eGradual Consistency (and Soft Transitions)\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse many animations to better convey your message. Difficult to explain without examples, the concept is that by making elements move (e.g. “As Is” → animation that kicks it out of the screen → “To Be” fades in) you can tell an animated story, super effective. Personally, I don’t like animations but the pattern can be useful for simple, key concepts. Use it sparsely, the book relies too much on that. Use soft transitions (dissolve, push) to shift delicately from slide to slide.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👻 \u003cstrong\u003eInvisibility\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn case of an audience that has already read the presentation and knows what you are going to talk about. Add an animation that begins with a blank page (and everyone will be focused on what you are talking about as they can’t be distracted), and then show the content. They can’t expect it in the printout: it will be a surprising moment, but in my opinion it’s too showy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👄 \u003cstrong\u003eLipsync\u003c/strong\u003e\n(For Live Demos). Playing live with the tool can be risky, as there are numerous unpredictable issues that can happen. Record yourself before the talk when using the tool and play the video while talking over it or in case of emergency. You can be less stressed, you can skip boring or lengthy moments, you can highlight certain parts. However, you can’t improvise if the audience asks you anything. Suggestion: hide Windows Tray and another unnecessary parts of the screen, as they will distract audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📼 \u003cstrong\u003eLive on Tape\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf travelling issues occur, video-record your presentation like you were live in that same room: this makes the video more natural and engaging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"deliver\"\u003eDeliver\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛹️‍♀️ \u003cstrong\u003ePreparation\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlways be ready for the worst-case scenario. Hard drives can fail, you can come in late, you lose your laptop charger… Prepare your kit in advance the night before and check all the setup (better overdress than not being formal enough), have a backup of the presentation and stay hydrated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🤝 \u003cstrong\u003eSeeding Satisfaction\u003c/strong\u003e\nLike Rock Bands that start with an opening act, you can shake hands, chat and warm up the audience before beginning the talk. Even one friendly face can make the difference, so introducing yourself to strangers and making some good impressions can help. It is also convenient to build connection with other people with the same interests and maybe make the expectations they have about you very clear. Don’t push too much if you see hat they don’t want to socialize.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💵 \u003cstrong\u003eDisplay of High Value\u003c/strong\u003e\nBy instinct, the audience consider the speaker as valuable with an high social status and interesting things to say. Use this concept at your advantage, show that you are prepared and comfortable with the situation. Don’t apologize for technical issues, but move on and keep talking. Don’t let other people (Hecklers) hijack your presentation. Don’t look confused when you can’t reply to a question, suggest ways to follow up later instead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔁 \u003cstrong\u003eCarnegie Hall\u003c/strong\u003e\nPractice. Practice.Practice. Present it to your pets first, then to a friendly crowd (friends, colleagues), record yourself if you want to. Trying to repeat it as much as possible forces yourself to get used to talk and to gain confidence and tweak out the small details of the presentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐻 \u003cstrong\u003eEmotional State\u003c/strong\u003e\nTry to understand the overall mood of the people involved, if they are having a good day and how they are feeling.

Embrace silences. When stressed, you tend to speak faster, to fill up every gap and constantly be active, which reveals your nervousness. Plan some tactical breaks during (and before) key moments, pay attention to the rhythm of your voice. Sometimes the author writes a symbol in the notes to remember to breathe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🦶 \u003cstrong\u003eShoeless\u003c/strong\u003e\nAchieve relax with little quirks to help ignoring the stress. Removing shoes may be a bit odd in corporate environments, but the pattern can be extended to everything that makes you more comfortable.

You have to be the mentor of the audience, their guide to a new world they don’t know. They need to feel that you care about it and leave the event enlightened with your wisdom. Preparing a strong Narrative Arc does help.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌧 \u003cstrong\u003eWeatherman\u003c/strong\u003e\nFace the camera like a Weatherman on the news, don’t look at the screen behind you but speak directly to your audience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍒 \u003cstrong\u003eSeeding the First Question\u003c/strong\u003e\nUsually the audience is embarrassed to ask the first question, you need to find a way to break the ice. A good idea is to serve an obvious question in your presentation. An idea could be mentioning advanced concepts so people can ask questions about them at the end as they are curious.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛈ \u003cstrong\u003eMake It Rain\u003c/strong\u003e\nMove things around (chairs, props, papers) to make the audience more comfortableç very useful in educational settings, but discouraged in corporate environments.

Don’t overuse it (leave the joke out if in doubt) or there is high risk of alienating the public; also, it should be relevant to your Narrative Arc and pay attention to not offend anyone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🕶 \u003cstrong\u003eThe Stakeout\u003c/strong\u003e\nALWAYS go to the talk earlier to avoid last-minute issues, get familiar with the environment, and, if possible, start chatting with the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔦 \u003cstrong\u003eLightsaber\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse the laser pointer judiciously like a skilled Jedi, highlighting the point of the slide you want to focus on when necessary. It’s not the best way as it attracts the complete attention of the audience, it’s better to use Traveling Highlights, but it gives you more freedom.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔂 \u003cstrong\u003eEcho Chamber\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen someone asks you anything, repeat it back to the audience (paraphrased).

Avoid the handshake image cliché at the end of the presentation, please.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👟 \u003cstrong\u003eBorrowed Shoes\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t present another person’s slides! It is surprisingly difficult to integrate your style with someone else’s one.\n✔ → Rework the initial material into something suitable for you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e☠ \u003cstrong\u003eSlideuments\u003c/strong\u003e\nAnother beloved antipattern from the authors, and a classic in the business world: a presentation that has to be also a document. There’s no free lunch: \u003cstrong\u003eyou can’t have both of them\u003c/strong\u003e!\n✔ → There is no real solution. Check Infodecks for an example of a working system. A workaround could be to create the presentation as usual, keeping it minimal, and then attach a more prosaic document (presentation notes) as .pdf so the audience can read it when looking for documentation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💀 \u003cstrong\u003eDead Demo\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt typically happens with Live Demos when the presenter is not prepared and fiddles around with the tool for lack of material or for personal ego. Boring.\n✔ → As said, it is very difficult to nail a Live Demo. Practice a lot (typing in public is way more stressful) and keep it short if you really have to show the tool.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"deliver-1\"\u003eDeliver\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔪 \u003cstrong\u003eShortchanged\u003c/strong\u003e\nSomeone else is still talking when it’s your time for presenting, making you lose precious time.\n✔ → It happens. Don’t feel rushed, don’t let anyone feel that this could be an issue. Be ready to skip some slides or sections. Don’t be afraid to assert yourself and ask the other person to stop the talk by hinting and setting your things up (or even interrupting).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥛 \u003cstrong\u003eHiccup Words\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you pollute your talk with nonwords such as ‘uhm’, ‘oh’, ‘eh’ or overused words such as ‘definitely’, ‘frankly’, ‘actually’. Happens during stressful moments, the brain is more comfortable with these words rather than awkward pauses. Very difficult to identify.\n✔ → Recognize your hiccup words by asking a friend to count them or recording yourself. Try to spot when the antipattern happens and take a breath, or rephrase it into something more articulate like ‘I’ll get to that detail later’. Don’t be afraid to be silent for a second.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔇 \u003cstrong\u003eDisowning Your Topic\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t change your presentation on the fly because you think your audience is not interested.\n✔ → Be prepared and Know Your Audience and this antipattern won’t occur. Remember that social hints may be misleading, and that you can’t please everyone. Just stick to what you have planned to minimize risk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🐖 \u003cstrong\u003eLipstick on a Pig\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhen you try to fix a bad presentation by to making it more aesthetically appealing. The slides are initially good, but your talk doesn’t leave any result in the long run.\n✔ → The authors recommend to set up a solid base before adding lipstick, suggesting “\u003cem\u003eone hour of preparation for every minute of presentation\u003c/em\u003e” (a bit too much in my case 😄). Time is the key, and all the previous pattern about having a clear and meaningful structure in mind.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🗼 \u003cstrong\u003eTower of Babble\u003c/strong\u003e\nUse technical jargon can be effective with the right audience, but can backfire, especially if you are doing it for flaunting your intellect. Difficult to notice if you talk “IT” every day.\n✔ → Know your audience and understand when and how much you can be more technical. For a business audience, stick to a simpler and more practical wording.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e☢ \u003cstrong\u003eBunker\u003c/strong\u003e\nMetaphorically ”hiding” behind the podium or showing distance from the audience, which is a natural behavior if one’s stressed.\n✔ → Know your audience and practice with your talk to achieve confidence, pay attention to your body language.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📣 \u003cstrong\u003eHecklers\u003c/strong\u003e\nThat kind of guest who monopolize your talk by continuously asking (often tricky) questions, making you lose time and patience. The agenda is at risk with heckers!\n✔ → Don’t be afraid to be the bad guy! Your scope is to protect your audience from time sinks. Don’t fell for the traps, but tell the heckler to follow up after the talk and remind him that you have a lot more to talk about. Deal decisively (eye contact, short sentences, firm tone).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎎 \u003cstrong\u003eGo Meta\u003c/strong\u003e\nDon’t talk about the talk, boooooring (e.g. technical issues you had before starting or anecdotes about the preparation).\n✔ → You already have limited time: focus on your Narrative Arc!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBackchannel\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt’s basically people tweeting or chatting with other people about the talk while you are speaking, which can bring distress and present a challenge. It’s not an antipattern, just a more complicate scenario because you may have to handle criticism in real time.\n✔ → Think about that when preparing the slides: can your message be condensed in a tweet? What’s the central point? Don’t be afraid to reply to questions and criticism during the event.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⚔ \u003cstrong\u003eLaser Weapons\u003c/strong\u003e\nLaser pointers can be effective for highlighting sections in dense slides, but they may be difficult to see for users in the back and are temporary: when you turn off the laser, the attention is gone.\n✔ → Better to use the Traveling Highlights and highlight directly in the slide\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🙋‍♂️ \u003cstrong\u003eNegative Ignorance\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you ask things like “Who’s not familiar with the XXX concept?” to better understand the level of the audience, it’s very likely that nobody will tell you the truth as they don’t want to feel stupid. Having incorrect feedbacks may bomb the presentation as you could act as too technical.\n✔ → Don’t ask these questions but be prepared (and, of course, Know Your Audience to avoid doubts). Keep in mind that part of the audience will know too much, part has no idea about the topic and the majority is in the middle. Prepare a 30-60 seconds summary of the advanced concept you want to introduce to keep as many people as possible engaged and informed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👾 \u003cstrong\u003eDual-Headed Monster\u003c/strong\u003e\nThis point is about the technical issues that can happen in case of an hybrid/online talk, which is not a real antipattern, just a slightly more difficult scenario. Outdated, as every presentation I make is online.\n✔ → Check the equipment, including the connection speed, and avoid Going Meta when an things break.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-others-presentations-slides\"\u003e❓ Others (presentations, slides)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"prepare-2\"\u003ePrepare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e😩 \u003cstrong\u003eRequired \u0026amp; Proposed (also Invited) Presentations\u003c/strong\u003e\nRequired → You have to speak (usually a difficult situation, yet it can become a low-risk opportunity to impress management and audience)\nProposed → You send an application for speaking at a conference, usually you are interested in the topic.\nInvited → You are so famous that conferences are asking you to speak there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔨 \u003cstrong\u003eExpansion Joints\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a clever trick to keep some slides that can be either skippable or a source for digression in case of time issues.

Psychological research shows that the average adult attention span is about 20 minutes. It is a good idea to split each Arc into that time frame, while the main Arc acts as a container for the entire talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e👁 \u003cstrong\u003eUnifying Visual Theme\u003c/strong\u003e\nA visual theme provides benefits as it is easier to connect visual elements to the topics you are presenting. Be creative, don’t use the default clip art and images, but at the same time don’t bend your presentation to match a theme. It’s nice to use metaphors and include them as images in the presentations. E.g. a plan sprouting from soil is a theme picked by Neal Ford in its emerging tech talk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⛈ \u003cstrong\u003eLightning Talk\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is a kind of presentation with fixed time limit, short in duration. It is difficult to create a meaningful story with limited material as it requires extensive preparation and there is no time for mistakes\u0026hellip; However it is a great occasion for being creative. You can cheat by using multiple slides with the same image and no transitions, which counts as 1 slide. \u003ca href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home\"\u003eIgnite conferences\u003c/a\u003e are an example of Lightning Talks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔫 \u003cstrong\u003eTakahashi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlso known as Lessig, it is a style of presentation with minimal imagery/verbiage and super fast transitions. Unlikely to be used with technical talks unless you want to insert a break in between, but very effective when delivering keynotes. You only need a lot of slides with one element each!

It is not meant to be presented, but rather consumed by a single person. Here you can include diagrams, (SHORT) bullet points, few words and work with a spatial layout. Pay attention to not transform it into a Slideument and create it knowing that you won’t likely have to present it → no animations, no big images, no Brain Breaks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🚢 \u003cstrong\u003eVacation Photos\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides with only full-screen images and very few (if no) words: extremely effective with storytelling, less in technical presentations, but keep it in mind as it is a key concept of the book. Users need to have an image in their minds, otherwise they will spend time and attention creating their own. Don’t distract them with too flashy images.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧯 \u003cstrong\u003eCharred Trail\u003c/strong\u003e\nA kind of slide specifically made to fix the issues with Slideuments and Bullet-Riddled Corpses. It’s an animated bullet point list where each point is appears one at a time and then grays out to keep the audience focused on the last element. The “printed” outcome will be like a classic bulleted slide, which is OK for documents, but while presenting you can make sure that the users won’t read all the bullets instead of listening. It requires a bit of tweaking with PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎩 \u003cstrong\u003eExuberant Title Top\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide type strictly related to the Charred Trail pattern (also in this case the printout will be Infodeck-friendly). The heading begins in the center of the slide and the hovers at the top while the body appear. Used to center the attention on the title, especially when it’s a bold assertion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📑 \u003cstrong\u003eContext Keeper\u003c/strong\u003e\nSimilar to Breadcrumbs but at a slide level: you can keep the same element (e.g. an image or a title) between slides while the rest changes to reveal the structure of the topic you are introducing. Suggestion: use the Morph animation in PowerPoint.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍞 \u003cstrong\u003eBreadcrumbs\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt is easy to lose track of the agenda if the presentation is long. A breadcrumb is a slide that can be added while transitioning between the points of the agenda to remind the audience what’s the general plan and at what point of the presentation we are. It can be a copy of the agenda slide with the current bullet highlighted in bold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e📚 \u003cstrong\u003eBookends (and Preroll and Crawling Credits)\u003c/strong\u003e\nSlides at the beginning and at the end of the presentation with your name and contacts. Useless in my current case, but it can reassure the audience that they are in the correct room, introduce yourself and, when concluding, they can contain other URLs, for example for downloading the slides or asking for feedbacks.\nPreroll is an automatic carousel of slides to play before the beginning two or three slides with information so you can save time and attention resources.\nCrawling Credits is the opposite: an animation in Star-Wars style of the Coda at the end. Cool yet nothing special to me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎬 \u003cstrong\u003eIntermezzi\u003c/strong\u003e\nAlternative to Breadcrumbs. While changing each logical part of the presentation, add a slide to introduce the new concept. We have it in our template, OK.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔙 \u003cstrong\u003eBacktracking\u003c/strong\u003e\nA slide to bring the attention back to another slide you have shown in the past. This element is used in case of a little digression where you open a Talklet and want to come back to the original agenda. Suggestion: use a distinctive “back” transition to close the digression.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🎦 \u003cstrong\u003eLive Demo\u003c/strong\u003e\nA special kind of presentation where you don’t need many slides, but you mostly use and present a tool. It can be the right way if you are talking about the tool and the audience is expected to mimic you and learn.\nIt is particuarly difficult to make a good Live Demo! Practice a lot, practice how to talk while using the tool to keep the audience interested, and expect to make mistakes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e✈ \u003cstrong\u003eTraveling Highlights (and Crawling Code)\u003c/strong\u003e\nFor slides with source code or huge amount of information, highlight the section you are talking about with a subtle window animation.\nCrawling Code adds boxed or highlights to the part of code mentioned, hiding all the rest to avoid distractions (e.g. \u003ca href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/encryption-boot-camp-on-the-jvm\"\u003eSlide 24 of Encryption Boot Camp on the JVM\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔔 \u003cstrong\u003eEmergence\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you want to reveal the key slide of your presentation, which requires a buildup first, slowly build hype with subtle animations to initially obscure part of the slide and then suddenly reveal the content, piece by piece.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/presentation_patterns_cover.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/01/personal-notes-about-presentation-patterns/","title":"Personal Notes about Presentation Patterns"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThere is something bizarre with me if two of my favourite activities are writing documentation and hitting my head against tests, which are notoriously unexciting activities for many developers 😫\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, we are all unique in our own way and I decided to contribute to \u003ca href=\"https://codecov.io/github/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003ethe testing module\u003c/a\u003e of one of my favorite libraries, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\"\u003enotion-sdk-py\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing \u003ca href=\"https://www.credly.com/badges/f15407b3-5fa8-4d9b-99cf-d862399a1543/public_url\"\u003ea certified Notion user\u003c/a\u003e, I use its Web App on a daily basis, and the Python library helps me automatically organize my notes.

This is a \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators\"\u003egenerator\u003c/a\u003e, a function that returns a lazy iterator which doesn’t store its content in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this method, there will be a final step for cleaning up everything and resetting the environment even in case of a failure.

E.g. \u003ccode\u003eColours = {”Red”, “White”, “Blue”}\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ccode\u003eAnimals = {(”Dog”, “Woof”),( “Cat”, “Meow”)}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"calculated-columns\"\u003eCalculated Columns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten as \u003ccode\u003e‘Table Name’[Column Name]\u003c/code\u003e, calculated columns are new columns added to the data model, and you can use them just like a default one, independently from the context. Just be aware that in Import Mode (the standard one), they are calculated during the data refresh, then stored in memory, occupying some precious RAM! If you have a complex formula, don’t break it down into intermediate steps as you do in Excel, but rather create and test it in DAX Studio and store the result in a single calculated column to optimize the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should use a calculated column if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe result will be in a slicer, matrix, pivot, or \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e condition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have an expression that is relative to the single row and doesn’t require aggregation, like \u003ccode\u003ePrice * Quantity\u003c/code\u003e which must use the Price of the row and the Quantity of the row\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have to categorize text or numbers, e.g. assigning a High, Medium, Low range, or 0-18, 18-25, 25+.

Generally, you should use them when you don’t want to calculate values for each row, but you want an aggregation: in fact, a measure has an implicit CALCULATE clause in its formula and is modified by the context (see Chapter 5). Here’s a good example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you create a calculated column like \u003ccode\u003eSales[GrossMarginPct] = Sales[GrossMargin] / Sales[SalesAmount]\u003c/code\u003e, you will see that the total is more than 100% (If our ten products have a 50% Gross Margin each, the table displays 50*10 → 500%)! DAX is applying the formula row-by-row, but we want to see the total instead.

It returns a list of unique values, requiring a table or a list of columns, not an expression; if you use \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e with more than a column, it will give back all the possible unique combinations existing in the table. \u003ccode\u003eALLEXCEPT\u003c/code\u003e can be translated as ‘take everything from that table except the following columns’. The rest will be explained in Chapter 14.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"valuesdistinctblank\"\u003eVALUES,DISTINCT,BLANK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike \u003ccode\u003eALL\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e return a list of unique values too… With a big difference. \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e returns the visible values, so it’s not ignoring the active filters, and the same does \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e. They are different in the case of invalid relations. There’s a great example in the chapter: if, for example, a product is missing from the Product table, the join between it and the Sales table will have blank rows in the results. In this case, \u003ccode\u003eDISTINCT\u003c/code\u003e gets confused when calculating the average amount for product, while \u003ccode\u003eVALUES\u003c/code\u003e considers the blank row correctly in the division.

If you understand context, you will avoid the most common errors when you code in DAX.

A context is, in short, the environment where the expression is evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filter-context\"\u003eFilter Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not able to explain it as well as in the book without examples, but here’s my personal interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a table with a measure, say \u003ccode\u003eTotalSales = SUMX(Sales[Amount]\u003c/code\u003e. A table has rows and cells. Every expression is evaluated based on its cell, which in turn is modified based on active filters and the selected column. So, the TotalSales measure will be, say, 30Mln if I put it into a card with no filters and just a cell, but if I use it in a table with multiple rows the is split based on the row’s contents (imagine a division by Area: Europe, US, Asia → 30mln will become 10mln x 3 cells. Behind the scenes, DAX is adding a \u003ccode\u003eFILTER\u003c/code\u003e saying \u003ccode\u003eFILTER (Area = ‘Europe’)\u003c/code\u003e and so on, for every cell). So, the filter context changes the outcome of the expression considering the filters that become active if, for example, it’s inside a specific cell of a table. What’s important is the context of the cell containing it: which is precisely the filter context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"row-context\"\u003eRow Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe example I recommend to read carefully uses this calculated column \u003ccode\u003eSales[Gross Margin] = Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e. Now remember, this column reasons in terms of rows, so, how does DAX manages to understand which row is working on? Using row context, which is basically a cursor. Row context, then, calculates the expression by considering the row that contains it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you write Gross Margin as a measure, you lose the row context, thus you need the iterative version ending with X: \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) )\u003c/code\u003e . The iterative version works because it uses SUMX, capable of keeping the row context. \u003ccode\u003eGross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] )\u003c/code\u003e is invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-notes\"\u003eOther Notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… The chapter goes on with several interesting examples and questions for understanding the contexts, especially when used in filters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of complex functions that work in two different contexts, there’s the \u003ccode\u003eEARLIER\u003c/code\u003e function for accessing the more external layer. Honestly, I hope to never use it, it’s extremely tricky, read the book to understand how the switch works, but even the authors admit that variables work better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden rule: \u003cstrong\u003erow context iterates, filter context filters\u003c/strong\u003e. Thus you can’t use the row context without a \u003ccode\u003eRELATED/RELATEDTABLE\u003c/code\u003e. On the contrary, the filter context uses relationships automatically, but be aware that its behavior can be different depending on the relationship’s direction (see chapter 15). I point out a very interesting example with \u003ccode\u003eSUMMARIZE\u003c/code\u003e in the case of the calculation of the average customers’ age without including duplicates: the code shows how to include a different column, read it carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-sql\" data-lang=\"sql\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCorrect Average :\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e AVERAGEX ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- Iterate on\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSUMMARIZE ( \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- all the existing combinations\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales, \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- that exist in Sales\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[CustomerKey], \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- of the customer key and\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t\tSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- the customer age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\t), \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e--\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSales[Customer Age] \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- and average the customer\u0026#39;s age\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e) \u003cspan style=\"color:#75715e\"\u003e-- TODO: you should break it down in a variable and use AVERAGEX too\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠️ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCALCULATE\u003c/code\u003e is the most important and powerful DAX function and the one with significant nuances to understand. \u003ccode\u003eCALCULATETABLE\u003c/code\u003e is the same but returns a table.

Again, see the example, sometimes this strategy can be slow, but it\u0026rsquo;s easily scalable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReducing the use of CallbackDataID: this is very nice; you can replace \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ROUND(Sales[Net Price],0))\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003eSUMX(VALUES(Sales[Net Price], CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]) * ROUND(Sales[Net Price]0)\u003c/code\u003e and the engine will store part of the query in memory, speeding up future operations!

I could give it a chance, it has good reviews for beginners. A surprising book. Extremely well written, with a story about Dan Harris\u0026rsquo; evolution, who has a very stressful and competitive job, and over the years he felt increasingly stressed and disliked by people. Starting from a few philosophy books he happened to read, he got interested, at first completely skeptical, but he kept going. He ended up in Buddhism, started meditating, even just 5 minutes a day, and it changed his life. Fantastic story, very realistic because he also calls the spiritual elements a bunch of nonsense, and he\u0026rsquo;s super practical! And on top of that it\u0026rsquo;s seasoned with his life as a journalist, full of insights and adventures. Like with the book by the consultant of How to Make Things Faster, the mix of personal stories and practical concepts works!

[\u0026hellip;] Communion with a single body here and now makes you feel connected with the entire cosmos. In truth, your beloved is just another human being, no different from all those you ignore every day on the train or at the supermarket. Yet to you, he or she seems infinite, and you are happy to lose yourself in that infinity.

The author distanced himself from it a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a stark book about how manipulation works. Like Cialdini\u0026rsquo;s and maybe Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, it draws fierce criticism, and people often blame the messenger. I am glad these books exist; I am not glad that many have treated them as a bible and then taken advantage of others. But it is not the knife\u0026rsquo;s fault if you use it to kill. And this is a sharp knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the book is off-putting. It reads as if it assumes that everyone around us is plotting, so you must strike from behind, lie, and generally be unpleasant to get ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you realize it is sadly like this in many environments.

So there is something sensible buried in this hefty book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read it quickly because it is long, and Greene adds four, five, six anecdotes for each rule, almost always with some Roman/Chinese/French general and some trick.

Typically, people are working extremely\nhard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your\nusers are vocally dissatisfied.\nA team is treading water if they\u0026rsquo;re able to get their critical work\ndone, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or\nbegin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are\nstill working hard, and your users may seem happier because\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve learned that asking for help won\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere.\nA team is repaying debt when they\u0026rsquo;re able to start paying down\ntechnical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt\nrepayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more\ntime to repay more debt.\n2.2.2\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably\nlow, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user\nneeds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-\ncovering the same patch. Don\u0026rsquo;t go there. Go somewhere that\u0026rsquo;s\ndisproportionately valuable to you because of who you are and\nwhat you want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the one thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found at companies with very few\ninterruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really\ngreat, consistently available documentation. It\u0026rsquo;s probably even\nharder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting\ncompany than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing\ncompany, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I\u0026rsquo;ve seen\nis a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a\ndocumentation search that actually works.\nThere are a non-zero number of companies that do internal\ndocumentation well, but I\u0026rsquo;m less sure if there are a non-zero\nnumber of companies with more than 20 engineers that do this\nwell. If you know any, please let me know so that I can pick their\nbrains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour first reaction might be to confront this head-on, but it takes\na while to build credibility after starting a new job. Sure, you\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen hired for your experience, so they respect your judgment,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s a hard sell to convince someone that your personal\nexperience should invalidate their personal experience.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying something different.\nModel. Start measuring your team\u0026rsquo;s health (maybe using short,\nmonthly surveys) and your team\u0026rsquo;s throughput (do some\nlightweight form of task sizing, even if you just do it informally\nwith a senior engineer on the team or with yourself), which will\nallow you to establish the baseline before your change.\nThen just start running kanban. Don\u0026rsquo;t publicize it, don\u0026rsquo;t make a\nbig deal about it, just start doing it with your team. Frame it as a\nshort experiment with the team, and start trying it. Keep iterating\non it until you\u0026rsquo;re confident it works. Have the courage to keep at it\nfor a while, and also the courage to stop doing it if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\nafter a month or two. Use the team\u0026rsquo;s health and throughput\nmetrics to ground your decision about whether it\u0026rsquo;s working.\nDocument. After you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered an effective approach,\ndocument the problem you set out to solve, the learning process\nyou went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. Be as detailed as possible:\nmake a canonical document, and even get a few folks on other\nteams to check that it\u0026rsquo;s readable from their perspective.\nShare. The final step is to share your documented approach,\nalong with your experience doing the rollout, in a short email.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t ask everyone to adopt the practice, don\u0026rsquo;t lobby for change,\njust present the approach and your experience following it.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that\nwork effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting\nhow you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to\nchange their approach.\nStrangely, in my experience, this has often led to more adoption\nthan top-down mandates have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few years to glean a lesson from that experience, but\nit comes to mind frequently now when I work with folks who are\njust starting to present to executives. Giving a presentation to\nsenior leadership is a bit of a dark art: it takes a while to master,\nand most people who do it well can\u0026rsquo;t quite articulate how they do\nit. Worse yet, many people who are excellent rely on advantages\nthat resist replication: charisma, quick wit, deep subject matter\nexpertise, or years of experience. Start with the conclusion. Particularly in written\ncommunication, folks skim until they get bored and then stop\nreading. Accommodate this behavior by starting with what\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant, instead of building toward it gradually.\nFrame why the topic matters. Typically, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting on\nan area that you\u0026rsquo;re intimately familiar with, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably very\nobvious to you why the work matters. This will be much less\nobvious to folks who don\u0026rsquo;t think about the area as often. Start by\nexplaining why your work matters to the company.\nEveryone loves a narrative. Another aspect of framing the topic\nis providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and\nwhere you\u0026rsquo;re going now. This should be a sentence or two along\nthe lines of, \u0026ldquo;Last year, we had trouble closing several important\ncustomers due to concerns about our scalability. We identified\nour databases as our constraints to scaling, and since then our\nfocus has been moving to a new sharding model that enables\nhorizontal scaling. That\u0026rsquo;s going well, and we expect to finish in Answer directly. Senior leaders tend to be indirectly responsible\nfor wide areas, and frequently pierce into areas to debug\nproblems. Their experience \u0026ldquo;debug piercing\u0026rdquo; tunes their radar for\nevasive answers, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a blip on that screen.\nInstead of hiding problems, use them as an opportunity to explain\nyour plans to address them.\nDeep in the data. You should be deep enough in your data that\nyou can use it to answer unexpected questions. This means\nspending time exploring the data, and the most common way to\ndo that is to run a thorough goal-setting exercise.\nDerive actions from principles. One of your aims is to provide a\nmental model of how you view the topic, allowing folks to get\nfamiliar with how you make decisions. Showing you are \u0026ldquo;in the\ndata\u0026rdquo; is part of this. The other aspect is defining the guiding\nprinciples you\u0026rsquo;re using to approach decisions.\nDiscuss the details. Some executives test presenters by diving\ninto the details, trying to uncover an area the presenter is\nuncomfortable speaking on. You should be familiar with the\ndetails, e.g., project statuses, but I think that it\u0026rsquo;s usually best to\nreframe the discussion when you get too far into the details. Try\nto pop up to either the data or the principles, which tend to be\nmore useful conversations.\nPrepare a lot; practice a little. If you\u0026rsquo;re presenting to your entire\ncompany, practicing your presentation is time well spent.\nLeadership presentations tend to quickly detour, so practice isn\u0026rsquo;t\n38\nquite as useful. Practice until you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable, but prefer to\nprepare instead getting deeper into the data, details, and\nprinciples. As a corollary, if you\u0026rsquo;re knowledgeable in the area\nyou\u0026rsquo;re responsible for, and have spent time getting comfortable\nwith the format, over time you\u0026rsquo;ll find that you won\u0026rsquo;t need to\nprepare much for these specifically. Rather, whether you\u0026rsquo;re able\nto present effectively without much preparation will become a\nsignal for whether you\u0026rsquo;re keeping up with your span of\nresponsibility.\nMake a clear ask. If you don\u0026rsquo;t go into a meeting with leadership\nwith a clear goal, your meeting will either go nowhere or go\npoorly. Start the meeting by explicitly framing your goal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis refined list of goals, aligned to your company\u0026rsquo;s priorities,\nthen becomes a central artifact for how you and your manager\ncollaborate on your career evolution. Every quarter or so, take\nsome time to refresh the document and review it together.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unconvinced that it\u0026rsquo;s worth your time to write a career\nnarrative, you certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have to write one. Most folks get\naway with not writing one for their entire career and have deeply\nfulfilling careers despite the absence.\nThat said, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, then there is probably no one guiding your\ncareer. Chasing the next promotion is at best a marker on a mass-produced treasure map, with every shovel and metal detector re-\ncovering the same patch. Don\u0026rsquo;t go there.

A very difficult and long book, but decidedly illuminating. Taleb is sharply polemical and candid, offering a unique perspective on modern economics and the fragility of systems. It is based on the concept of antifragility, meaning something that benefits from volatility (unlike fragile things and robust ones, which merely recover). It is anything that has more upside than downside from random events. Here are the main ideas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNature is very important for Taleb (at times, in my view, a bit extreme).

Modern theories often miss this fundamental part, like the turkey before Thanksgiving\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHormesis. The absence of stress and competition, as well as an overabundance of choices, harms us. Taleb favors constant self-testing, \u0026ldquo;poisoning\u0026rdquo; oneself in small doses to build strength\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBarbell Method: to benefit from Black Swans, the ideal is a method that loses a little and often and gains when a shock occurs.

I have to say the read was engaging, a 4-star for the author\u0026rsquo;s humor (same vibe as Uncanny Valley) as he pokes fun, with solid satire, at the UN\u0026rsquo;s machinery, which at the time was operating in Iraq for the Food-for-Oil program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, the story is that Saddam\u0026rsquo;s regime sold oil to a roster of companies and trusted figures, who took a cut to resell it at a higher price worldwide, giving a portion back (kickback) to Iraq. This was in exchange for food, medicine, and equipment for the population, though the money in truth did not reach them.

A must read that in 400 pages helped me understand what is actually behind a computer, with practical examples, clever details, and a lot of knowledge. A couple of final chapters were too tough, but otherwise I came away amazed and fascinated by this complicated world I did not know. One of the most beautiful and useful books I have ever read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecode means a system for transferring information among people and machines, aka to communicate. The Italian vocabulary is itself a code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction with Morse code used to communicate between two houses by the child protagonists who only have flashlights, already impressive. Key idea is two: dots and dashes, binary. Introduction to powers of two to explain the number of possible combinations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to Braille, which has a fascinating history and an ingenious structure that saves a lot of space with abbreviations and prefixes that alter the following words (shift codes). With two to the sixth combinations, a reminder of binary concepts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to electricity and how a flashlight works\u0026hellip; the battery has many atoms exchanging electrons, closing the circuit with a chemical reaction between the two ends. I = E/R, with current as how much electricity is flowing (Ampere), Resistance (Ohm) is how much the material blocks it, and E is voltage, how much potential energy there is. A disconnected battery always has the same voltage, but very high resistance since air does not conduct. Useful. Wattage for light bulbs is E x I\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSurprising: you can use grounding to conduct electricity using the Earth itself. Plant a large copper rod (symbolizes the beginning of the circuit, aka V). This way you do not need a second wire because the ground closes the circuit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of the telegraph, which opened and closed circuits making a click-clack sound to be translated into Morse code. Connections were copper wire between the first utility poles. Explanation of repeaters, which connected the click-clack sounder to the input and repeated the same thing instead of requiring human effort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of number systems, which are themselves a code. For me the number 3 stands for three because I assign that meaning to it. Zero was a tremendous invention. A digression on non-decimal systems by pretending to be a cartoon character with 8 fingers (brilliant, you understand how a base-8 system thinks by excluding 8 and 9). Excellent introduction to the bit, which is the binary digit (reasoning with a code of only 0 and 1, explained well by simulating being a dolphin with only two fingers/fins)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHistory of binary code, the simplest possible system for counting. Any information can be broken down and expressed in bits. For example a barcode is a sequence of spaces and lines symbolizing 0 and 1 in succession, and since there are many they allow 2 to the x combinations of codes. They have a lot of checks to prevent a barcode from being tampered with or misprinted (but in the end the same numbers are printed in clear text under the code). Shows both Morse and Braille converted into binary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanation of Boole and boolean logic. It connects to logic gates, which use current in series and in parallel to simulate + and x statements as if they were switches. Good parallel on how they physically correspond to current on and off and I learned AND, NAND, OR, and NOR\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBinary machine: build an adder from the components of the previous chapter. Introduced the XOR gate, which gives 1 if only one of A or B is 1, combining OR and NAND. Use an XOR and an AND to add bits with a carry if both are 1 (10). It ends up looking like this. PCs still use a system like this at the base, but obviously with microscopic, fast transistors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSubtraction is like addition but uses borrow instead of carry. If both bits are one you take the borrow from the column to the left and not the right. Overview of the machine with this feature, similar structure. To avoid the hassle of borrow it uses a trick with 9s called nine\u0026rsquo;s complement. Mathematical detail I can skip here. Introduction to overflow, which warns you if the number is larger than the bits available. To combine add and subtract it has another gate that defines the operation. If subtract, it simply inverts B with the ones\u0026rsquo; complement (like 9s but in binary). For example 9 - 4 will be 9 + (-4). Another trick for signs: instead of using a separate bit for the minus, split the available bits. For example from 0 to 499 the positives, and from 500 to 999 the negatives. This causes errors so that if you run out of bits then from 499 + 1 you go to -499. Now I get it. The leftmost bit will be 0 for positives and 1 for negatives. A number with this property is signed vs unsigned, and subtraction works in this somewhat convoluted way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeedback: introduces an oscillator, a relay with input = output that alternates quickly between 0 and 1. It can also be called a clock because it oscillates at regular, measurable intervals, aka cycles per second aka Hertz. It also covers flip-flops, which are a cross-coupled feedback of two NORs to remember the system state. A complex trick to create a latch, which allows setting and resetting a variable to a number, which can then be connected to the previous machine. They are also very useful for counting on each oscillation. I got lost here, I admit it, but I understand why they count so quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to hexadecimal code, the one used in colors, which for numbers beyond 9 uses A, B, \u0026hellip; F. Brilliant. It is used because 8 bits are a byte, and for big numbers two bytes are enough, so base sixteen is convenient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscusses memory, in particular RAM which stores some bytes to read and write information quickly not in sequence (as if it were a locker). ROM instead is sequential, and uses a control panel to access the appropriate addresses\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutomation: very dense chapter about opcodes and assembly, and how we can use two RAMs to store information (example of addition and multiplication). Here it goes into memory addresses, in this case 2 bytes, and there is a third byte for the instruction, which can be Load, Add, Subtract, Carry with Zero, Halt, and other precise situations. Quite heavy because it is more complicated than that, but in practice it works like this, and we have just seen the split between Data and Code. One RAM stores data in memory and accepts instructions in the form of other encoded bytes. To reread\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecap of the history of computers, from the first abaci to Babbage to the founder of IBM who used punch cards to Turing and Von Neumann, of which we built a replica earlier. They first use vacuum tubes and telephone relays, but transistors revolutionize everything by being semiconductors. They use metals like silicon between two doped layers of semiconductors that reduce heat and size. Chips exploit this layering even more to pack many connectors into a small space. Moore created this law about power roughly doubling every few years. In the end a computer moves a byte from one place to another, back and forth. Speed is essential for power, which is why there has been a race to put as many bits as possible on each microprocessor and to improve materials. Very complex chapter on how they handle information at that level and on how x86, x64, and company do not play well together\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eASCII and characters. Computers have everything in bits so how we want to display them depends on the chosen format, meaning how we choose to translate bits into text. Baudot assigns two hex bits for 30 letters, with a special one to switch to numbers if needed (like CAPS). ASCII standardizes hex into characters and is essential for computers to understand each other. It has a very interesting feature where you can subtract 20h to go from uppercase to lowercase. It was created with punch cards where you chose the hex and wrote things for the computer. Since they had not accounted for Asian writing systems and special symbols, Unicode was introduced with 16 bits and 65k characters. A bit larger but much less ambiguous\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePart about the bus I will skip because I did not understand it. RAM and ROM\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOperating System. This is indeed a challenge because when you turn off the PC, RAM loses everything it had in memory. An OS has a sequence of commands to reestablish the situation and is used to set commands for the computer in memory. Line by line the data is saved in memory thanks to OS instructions. Included there is a file system, which contains all the paths of objects, which are essentially memory addresses. Introduction to CP/M, a very basic system, and the subsequent rise of Linux, UNIX, GNU. Interesting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduction to fractional and irrational numbers, which we still need to represent in bits. Idea of fixed-point format where there is a certain bit with the decimal fixed, for example two decimal places. There is also floating-point notation where you express the number in a particular decimal notation. Very efficient, but it becomes less precise with large numbers so for banks and the like you keep fixed point, while for something like YouTube views floating is fine. To do operations with this complexity of floating points Intel had to make a dedicated chip in the 80s\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMicroprocessors do not understand assembly language so you need to translate it into bytes, that is, compile it, turning it into an executable. Compilers are even tougher because they synthesize commands in high-level languages into a few bytes and this requires structure. Low-level languages can communicate more directly with the machine and this can lead to interesting performance tricks like bit shifting accumulation. Uses ALGOL as a reference for a high-level language, which feels familiar. The low-level part had me lost in the instructions, it is now less useful in general cases. Example program in ALGOL, very familiar structure, and a brief history of the evolution of programs, from COBOL to FORTRAN to C, Lisp and company\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGraphics section.

First, park in a safe spot where you can take your time. For a small puncture you can temporarily use foam sealant. If you need to change it you need a jack and a four-way lug wrench. Read the manual, lift the car at the designated point with the jack and loosen the lug nuts. You may need force and a bit of oil. Bring a rag just in case. I saw how to do it in Switzerland: remember to put out the triangle and wear the vest, then work calmly, remove the hubcap if it\u0026rsquo;s clipped in, possibly the wheel cover, then place the jack where indicated (about 16 cm from the tire), loosen the nuts a bit, lift until you have a finger of clearance, remove the nuts without losing them, swap the wheel, tighten in a criss-cross pattern to balance the load, lower the car and give the nuts a final tighten, then drive off without rushing. Lesson learned.\nAnother tip: if the jack fails and the car drops, you might not be able to lift it again. Place wood or something sturdy as a safety support, and if the ground is unstable chock the other wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Oil leaks: if you see a spot under the car, identify the source.

You can try to trace the source and see if a gasket is leaking and can be fixed, but you will likely need a mechanic to replace it. Not an emergency but deal with it soon.

Not urgent, but low oil can damage the engine over time, and if it runs out the engine can fail. If the level looks fine or the light behaves oddly (red or flashing), that\u0026rsquo;s a concern.

Wait a bit, then start yours and let it recharge while still connected, then take a short drive to confirm all is okay. When working on a battery always remove the negative cable first and reconnect it last. Check for corrosion now and then, and remove it with a small brush if needed. Batteries often have a hydrometer eye indicator that shows, by color, if it\u0026rsquo;s charged, discharged, or needs service.\nStill on the battery, test before replacing: charge it and see if it holds. If it cannot hold a charge, it is done.

This nice video shows how to change it. Not a big concern, aside from the first time when all the fluid drains out, which can be surprising. Depends on the car. It only costs 10-30 euros at a mechanic, so I would let them do it. Check the car\u0026rsquo;s instructions to know which coolant you need. I tend to confuse it, probably an antifreeze/coolant mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throttle body (3️⃣) is a key engine component and can be cleaned easily.

You can also open the hood and see if there is debris in the air intake (filters 2️⃣). The book then describes a more involved disinfecting with specific products, worth reading up on.

For others there are kits to repair as soon as possible before it becomes a crack. It must be completely dry, and you apply the kit carefully to the glass, which looks like a small patch or an injector of adhesive, depending on the kit. See if it works.

Remove as much water as possible before mold grows, there will be water everywhere. If it reaches the ECU there may be irreparable damage, check the high-water mark carefully. Check the oil filter; if it has water droplets you may need an oil change. If water got inside, air out and clean mats and interior, and rinse external components that may have gotten dirty like the brakes. The onboard computer should be removed and cleaned with great care since it is not waterproof. Also check the lights. In theory they are fine, but water can get in and you need to dry the housing. In general electrical components are protected. Test thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepair paint chips (💥). Since a body shop can be expensive, you can try to fix it by buying primer and clearcoat, because the paint is layered. Mask the area to fill, sand it (the book lists grits) and apply the suggested products. Again, check the chapter images. If you are not satisfied, you can try spray paint (still masking the area) and then lightly sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e💥 Removing stickers (maybe the vignette).

Wear eye protection because of flying debris, and you cut the pipe. I will not do this, so if it happens I will read that chapter. Most issues are rust.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Suspension (3️⃣ restore if used hard): you notice because the car takes hits poorly, like a truck. I think the book focuses on SUVs/vans in this chapter. You unscrew and inspect various components, especially shocks. They should be replaced about every 60k miles, depending on use, but replacement is complex. I saw a video and I would not do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange oil and filter (the car alerts you): there is a video on how, but you need a way to raise the car. I will have a mechanic do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange the water pump (1️⃣0️⃣): watch if coolant temperature climbs a lot; around 100k km it should be replaced. Be alert if there are leaks, which is rare, since it can seriously damage the engine. If you smell coolant, pay attention. With recent tech it should be reliable anyway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The starter solenoid (or starter motor) is the device that engages the engine with the battery when you turn the key. If it fails you hear click-click-click as it spins without engaging (happened before). Could also be a battery issue. On the Dacia I will not touch it, it is just useful to know this component exists, like a small switch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 Ignition timing matters. The timing belt is a gear system you might adjust if the engine struggles to accelerate. There is a close-up of what I mean. They mark the current position on the pulley and turn it a certain way. I doubt I will ever do this. If needed, reread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The engine mount (5️⃣ they start to crack) protects the engine from shocks and vibrations. If it has issues you notice jerks and engine vibrations. Replace if needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e💥 The cooling fan is one or two large fans that run the AC and help cool the engine. If it fails you will get hot air and risk overheating. They show how to check the connectors with a battery, and you can test the fan directly. I doubt I can do much beyond that. Replacing it is involved; you have to remove a lot around the engine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe transmission filter (and fluid) (3️⃣). There is a video that gives the idea. It reminds me of the oil filter and I may be mixing them up. I would have a mechanic do it since it takes some skill (unscrew, clean, scrape), though it is not the most complex job. It matters because it manages the driven wheels. Do they do this during service? If it is not right, steering or response may feel off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHitching a trailer, if I ever need it.

Example: an online courses company that kept adding new items to hit targets, but everything was rushed and poorly done, and users did not use it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. Focus on end results, not on what you produced\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA product has no inherent value. What matters is what it does for the customer, e.g., solving a problem\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you do not measure the impact of your work on the customer, you will never know which outcomes you are delivering\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSales-led organizations do not work. Sales does not know what to bring, so they overpromise, and IT struggles. The process should start with the product manager, who listens to the customer, focuses on a problem, tests a feature on a small scale, and provides Sales with a roadmap they can take forward\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo product-led companies set a general strategy, then follow with features to achieve that goal (e.g., increase the number of courses per instructor), prioritizing projects with the highest impact\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConcept of known knowns and unknown unknowns.

You need a strategy and core values to follow, making hard choices without straying from them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is not a plan. It is a decision-making framework\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExamples of good frameworks: DIBBs (Spotify) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Data, Insights, Beliefs, and Bets. OKRs (Google, others) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Objectives \u0026amp; Key Results. BPM (Twilio, via First Round) \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Big Picture, Priorities, Measures\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVision: more of a general direction that guides philosophical choices over the long term. Always keep it in mind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo clarify the differences. Netflix example: Strategic intent = lead the streaming market.  Product initiative = enable people to watch Netflix on any device, wherever viewers wanted to.

We usually leverage several storage solutions, as each kind of DB can work in a specific environment. Questions to make when choosing: is it compatible with our speed rates, if it could be a bottleneck, if I understand how the tech works, if it will anticipate future scale, if the vendor will guarantee the SLA, if we capture metadata, if it’s pure (Object Storage) or if it supports query patterns (cloud DWH), if it’s schemaless/hybrid/enforced, how we are tracking records and schemas and governance. Also remember the difference between hot and cold data (for compliance but not accessed)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIngestion: this is usually the bottleneck of the data architecture, while source systems, the biggest culprit, is not under our control and responsibility. Let’s focus on making a reliable system by asking these questions: the use cases, what are the systems generating the data and when are they available, what’s the data destination, how frequently do I need to access the data and in which volume, what’s their format, is it in good shape or do I need to modify them. Plus differences between batch and streaming ingestion, usually it’s more efficient and simpler batch (and way more used unless you have a critical need for live data)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTransformation: the stage where you transform the data from being used in the next parts of the process.

Deliver value early and often\n• Interoperability → it needs to interact with existing systems (ODBC, JDBC, REST)\n• Cost optimization and business value → TCO, TOCO to calculate\n• Immutable versus transitory technologies → Use a two-year time horizon to reevaluate your technology choices. Lindy effect: the longer a technology has been established, the longer it will be used. Remember Hive\n• Location (cloud, on prem, hybrid cloud, multicloud) → very nice info about how cloud providers store data to avoid bottlenecks. Rn you need to keep one eye on the present while planning for unknowns\n• Build versus buy → investing in building and customizing when doing so will provide a competitive advantage for your business. Otherwise, stand on the shoulders of giants and use what’s already available in the market. Prefer OSS and COSS\n• Monolith versus modular → monolith can become a trap, decide based on flexibility and interoperability\n• Serverless versus servers → usually serverless makes sense unless the usage is so high to require a server. Decide based on workload, cost and limitations\n• Optimization, performance, and the benchmark wars → don’t trust those things as each case is different\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-generation-in-source-systems\"\u003eData Generation in Source Systems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOLTP vs OLAP, usual.

Great. Great. Great. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those books that surprises you, exceeding expectations in an incredible way. Instead of boring me with Oracle technical details (which are briefly touched on) Cary talks about how to communicate, understand the problem, and optimize it. A must-have treatise for all consultants, a work of art in problem solving. Much appreciated. It\u0026rsquo;s also well written, with many instructive stories, a tight pace, and simplified technical passages for a very pleasant read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🔑 Optimization is more a political problem than a technical one. And it\u0026rsquo;s curious that optimization books are mostly technical. This one won\u0026rsquo;t be. In fact, he knew the technical solutions and they were always the same (some parameter to set or a query to optimize); that wasn\u0026rsquo;t what made him good.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHis consulting process was 1. Listen, 2. Stay calm, 3. Convince them you have the solution, 4.

Because many individuals die (predation, diseases, access to food), keeping the number of elephants more or less constant. But on what basis did some die and others survive? Because some were stronger (or rather more suited) than others. In short, there was a kind of selection between who lives and who dies. Here is the missing piece. Here is how species evolve. It was natural selection. Under given environmental conditions only the most suited survive; the others die. Those who survive have offspring and pass their traits to their children. Generation after generation, the most suitable traits are selected. But note: Darwin reached these conclusions many years after his return. This shows an important point, namely that Darwin did not say anything new. He only connected the dots that good fortune had already aligned along his path, ready for someone to notice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarconi had three strokes of luck at once.

The signal leaves, pong, pong, and arrives right above the detector.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarconi, proceeding by trial and error without really knowing what he was doing; Marconi, who made major mistakes but succeeded anyway; on one side meritocracy, on the other a privileged battering ram with a lot of luck.

I was the wrong audience, though I see why they recommend it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the gist, the golden rule of improvisation, is to forget what we think we know. Children, who have not yet been boxed in creatively, often come up with solutions that are more creative than those of older students and adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, to improvise, do not overthink. Say what you actually have in mind, even if it seems silly, crude, or unkind. Also, let people be free to create and invent: the more restless students are often the ones who most need to channel their creativity, and stifling it is a waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother key point is that in a conversation, someone leads and someone yields. Status matters, and you should always pay attention to power dynamics in a conversation. With a few words you can flip them, which can give you an advantage, for example when you need to persuade someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you improvise, you reveal your true self.

Quelli in polvere sono leggergente piu efficaci ed economici, però calano di qualità se la temperatura di lavaggio non è almeno 60 gradi. Dato che ormai in Europa tendiamo ad usare 30-40 gradi, meglio i liquidi che agiscono bene a quelle temperature. I pod sono piu pratici e spesso contengono miscele che amalgamandosi nel lavaggio potenziano la formula in diversi scompartimenti idrosolubili (i vari “colori” del pod) quindi sono piu efficaci).

C’è molta fuffa marketing dato che la formula è la stessa (tensioattivi che proteggono uno strato del tessuto dal calcare), cambiano perlopiù i profumi, scegli quello che ti piace.

Infatti c\u0026rsquo;è di solito un piatto rotante per risolvere il problema\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePer esempio si può cuocere (con un po\u0026rsquo; d\u0026rsquo;acqua) verdure come zucchine, patate, peperoni, carote, broccoli, cipolle, zucche con ottimi risultati, mantenendo croccantezza ed evitando cattivi odori\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn verità ha una potenza fissa (spesso 600kw). Semplicemente mentre regoliamo esso si spegne per tot millisecondi per diminuire il tempo in cui è acceso e dare una temperatura media più bassa\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSconsigliato per cibi poveri d\u0026rsquo;acqua (tipo pane secco). Se cuoci cibi che assorbono poco un buon trucco è di mettere un bicchiere d\u0026rsquo;acqua dentro che assorba le onde, che potrebbero rovinare l\u0026rsquo;apparecchio\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"verdure\"\u003eVerdure\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧅 Cipolla: trucco per non piangere è bagnate il coltello per ridurre l\u0026rsquo;impatto dei suoi enzimi e non rivolgere la parte tagliata verso di te (cubettini partendo da lontano)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🧄 Aglio: l\u0026rsquo;enzima che crea l\u0026rsquo;odore reagisce solo quando tagliamo/schiacciamo l\u0026rsquo;aglio. Evita l\u0026rsquo;aglio già tritato, che ha perso tutto l\u0026rsquo;odore fresco. Alimento molto salutare (ma lo dice per tutte le verdure). Non schiacciarlo se vuoi tenere un odore più delicato. Si può conservare in un luogo fresco e buio per mesi\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍅Pomodoro: in realtà è una bacca, e a parte i fun fact sulla sua natura e sapore è utile sapere che si conserva a 13/22 gradi, nel frigo perde molto aroma nel tempo. Se possibile, tenerlo in un posto più fresco che freddo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫑 Peperoni: trucco è di ammorbidirli un po\u0026rsquo; al microonde tagliati a fettine, dato che contengono molta acqua, e poi passarli in padella con olio e aglio. Non sopportano molto il freddo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍏 Le mele e altri frutti climaterici come albicocca, banana, pera, pomodoro maturano in base all etilene, una sostanza che gli segnala che è ora di ammorbidirli. Esso si trasforma in zuccheri. Se una mela prende una botta, occhio perché si scurisce ed essendo sottoposta a stress può diffondere etilene alle altre, facendole maturare e ammollire\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌵 Asparagi: sarebbero da mangiare appena raccolti o comunque appena comprati dato che continuano a crescere in fretta, indurendosi e perdendo zuccheri. Se riesci a piegarlo a più di 90 gradi non è fresco, non troppo flessibile. Anche loro sono consigliatissimi al microonde per intrappolare il sapore della loro acqua all\u0026rsquo;interno e non perderlo in giro (3/4 minuti a 800W). E si, c\u0026rsquo;è almeno una molecola che li fa un po\u0026rsquo; puzzare perché simile a quella che usiamo noi per dare odore al gas (e sentire le fughe).\n\u003cimg src=\"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4c4d32bb-a99f-4134-b428-47124052748a/281728a5-4f9d-498c-9af3-4e63d3872f89/image-1693727152154.jpg2295964374696868672.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466WYAZJD7Z%2F20251218%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20251218T162816Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEND%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIG8KP4h64iyy49B2NblEw3f6UbTVQYIuCHoQiF4Dw%2F4iAiEAnnW4levBN25vzTGaCgTBnpni2lGQMrd91UNpM5d4LKoqiAQImf%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDD5wWHVopTvaAuqa2CrcA5YzUfCmdjQlXk6dpz09FElHKIbU9F5bYOJtbjHYfoOrmUBZ%2F76CF3hwTktsapMS8ep5CcU%2BLD3Gtdiog2IYLVf%2Boz0eyvL8fspBqGv9lKRM48InKb8Y%2FIgF5zPi8u6SLzlPK0OKCqROOYkHj8ZoUyQCexKg9dLYVonmRXyjacKjZZpTt9Ey3%2BIj1fYI%2Fv8xsRUrF1XOOPByNz40BFtiF0xua44GZFysGU0Cu0uD9cSchOwrTFGNKdWbu2D4wcNQ6qsJQLtN9kLepkct3fyGpe83cBWCwdxMFLJm8lqg6Z8RuiQUgh%2BMoPOwiT3eLZQXSRwd%2FQ%2F%2BLPSTcnd3ShrRC9%2FGO4WyaACY%2FDLwjR8VBa12Hh17IuVjrPy4vq5PAIaE40hC74yxGmVyLh9S5MsfQw%2B9O3ezKDf8lVf0fbeUO4InmO1NbmVI%2BU%2BOiWng37vxLcFzGHwQyfNHq6L5XzEt44w%2B7C%2BfDJYYym%2B9QWb2NF23JvkS5uv2%2FtTiFTGFOdxtrEU3rss1%2BfjfLB0G5bTx90LlXu7yeSSLo%2Bv%2FVPPBR7PZYRL8GQD7%2FVlvRK7pK8Jv1ZHh7mIo2pMh2afCDL%2B2WeOjroTb6fpAT1Bwu7MzZG%2Bw2b4K2yLAOwLzVtaYMPDMkMoGOqUBLkuoZu9jtdQDPWPboOHRHCGZ1FY3BN968Y7%2F0fcalxW%2Bvj7OjSftdRJqXyK9z2pKVoC5cKz%2FxZJDTek%2F4gTsfZk07h7rBALbTTwWpMNbEpowyqvkedVNg3pUZHb0ICyyAweDloOcrjwDBCRy7o2bHNH9fw7Cn7m6p9MTE44Xd7GJNH5JCTubqE2s39eywgva0VmUdPmLUlzT2U9ITqjhCZZCRbhQ\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=7d0b19ff75640608e93b9d4a7c1ba32c3ead6134366d6dffbd39b59d0e0a13c4\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED\u0026amp;x-id=GetObject\" alt=\"image\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🌿 Basilico: consiglia di tagliarlo a chiffonade (arrotolando le foglie e poi fare striscine), ottimo anche per insalate col pomodoro. Miglior modo è comprare una piantina da tenere sul balcone tagliandola dei suoi rametti e foglie a 10/15cm dal basso, lascinadone da due a quattro coppie per ricrescere. In questo modo avremo basilico fresco per tutti i mesi estivi. In frigo soffre tremendamente il freddo, sarebbe meglio tagliarlo e congelarlo  in un sacchettino (diventerà nero, un processo estetico simile alla nostra abbronzatura, ma tiene l\u0026rsquo;aroma). Si può anche seccare al microonde.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥕 Carote: in origine erano gialle e viola, fino al 1600, poi per una mutazione genetica sono state selezionate quelle arancioni, che erano più comode (quelle viola coloravano il brodo di viola e non si vedeva niente). Quelle viola si chiamano carote nere e sono usate molto come colorante\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🫒 Olio: si può creare da tantissimi alimenti, oliva, soia, girasole, etc… e sono più o meno insterscambiabili! Questo perché non esiste una molecola specifica, contengono gli stessi acidi grassi, legati ai trigliceridi, in percentuali diverse. Semplifichiamo in vegetali = insaturi e animali = saturi ma non sempre è vero. Quelli non sono interscambiabili, hanno proprietà chimiche diverse, quindi devi sempre sostituire saturi con saturi, soprattutto nei dolci. Gli oli vergini sono creati solo con procedimenti meccanici, senza modifiche chimiche, e quelli extravergine hanno bassi acidi liberi (sapore meno amaro). Usa lextravergine a freddo e olio di semi per friggere e soffriggere se possibile.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🍆 Melanzane: soffre il freddo, non tenerla troppo in frigo. Sceglile tale che se premi sulla superficie, dovrebbe comprimersi e poi tornare allo stato originale. No cappuccio marrone, vuol dire che è vecchia. Friggerle è complicato, meglio una passata in microonde per un paio di minuti almeno non assorbe troppa acqua e olio.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e🥔 Patate: si conservano fuori dal frigo al buio, occhio alla luce che causa produzione di solanina, tossica. Per il pure meglio usare uno schiacciapatate che il frullatore, che rompe troppo le fibre e causa un composto colloso. Fate bollire le patate con la buccia, assorbono meno acqua e acquisiscono un po\u0026rsquo; più di sostanze nutritive. Si possono cuocere al microonde prima di friggere, con il coperchio per aumentare efficacia.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3

E devo dire che il libro mi ha molto impressionato sul lato dell’etica, perchè anche se il mio lavoro non impatta direttamente la vita delle persone, indirettamente le conseguenze sono molto rilevanti. Mike cita casi famosi come Cambridge Analytics o Greyball: qualcuno li ha progettati e creato il codice, ed è sua responsabilità.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl problema è che noi designer-creatori non abbiamo voce in capitolo spesso, facciamo quello che ci dicono di fare: obiettivo di “Ruined By Design” è di spronarci ad opporci a richieste non etiche, e essere i gateway per fare del mondo un posto migliore.

We will do this Saturday at noon.\nAFTER\nWe’re moving Jimmy’s party to the new trampoline park this Saturday at noon.\nWhy It Matter\nBEFORE\nThe only hitch is it’s a little farther than we originally planned. The rst spot we were\nlooking at was a 30-minute drive, but the trampoline park has a lot more space, so we\npicked it even though it’s about 40 minutes away.

Laying Plans\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet’s start by saying that Modeling is the projection of business requirements. Having a clear and structured model is the key to a reliable database, keeping in mind that it is still an approximation of the reality and no size it it all. We just want to avoid crazy queries.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNormalization is a logical process to data modeling, to be strictly followed when laying down the schema of a DB and minimize inconsistency: 3 steps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnsure Atomicity → use IDs instead of description/names to identify rows. You have to make sure that searching for, say, the customer, returns all the rows without worrying about misspelling or slow “like” statements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Dependence on the Whole Key → keep columns to a limit: e.g. if same car models share the same information about car details, move them to another table that can be joined through the car model key. Don’t keep redundant data in the main table for performance reasons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck Attribute Independence → separate the independent attributes, for example country code details, which can be stored in another table connected through a non primary key to the row. This further minimized data redundancy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention with nulls: a red flag is when the majority of the columns contains null values, and if two columns can’t both be not null at the same time. Also, avoid using this kind of statement where color not in (\u0026lsquo;BLUE\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;BLACK\u0026rsquo;, null) because the engine doesn’t know what NULL is so there may be bugs (check with MSSQL though). In general, avoid nulls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTuning is about getting the best possible performance, now. When we develop, we must have a different mindset and not think “let’s code it, and then have a specialist tune it later in production.” Focus on not making a bad model, which is the main cause of bad performances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving different sources can be a performance killer, other than making the system more complex and difficult to maintain. Try to insert some rows locally and then through a DB Link. Centralizing data should be a key priority. The nearer you are to your data, the faster you can get at it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-waging-war\"\u003e2.

Leave comments in the code to explain when the code is used to eventually identify and track down issues. Make the statements identifiable!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA database connection is fundamentally a “heavy,” or high-resource operation. Don’t do like in the example, where for each line it was opening a connection! Try to insert data in chunks to maximize speed. However, this doesn’t scale too well when updating rows, better use one swoop statement to outperform them all\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStand back from your problem and possibly tackle the challenge with a fresh mind. Sometimes thinking outside the box can dramatically fix a problem, such as a performance issue that the author optimized with an UNION statement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaximize each visit to the database by asking for all the columns you will need in one single statement, even if you are not using them all immediately. If you have to retrieve different values (e.g. max and min date) don’t use two statements, for example!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing the DB native kernel and functions provided by the DBMS will always be more performant rather than building other abstraction layers on top of it (e.g. PL/SQL is slower than a SQL function)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid counting rows if not necessary (classic select count(*) into counter from table_name where \u0026lt;certain_condition\u0026gt; if (counter \u0026gt; 0) then \u0026hellip;). It is more performant to use native tools like @@ROWCOUNT or SQL%ROWCOUNT or MERGE when inserting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are several ways to achieve procedural logics in a DB application. Even if it is conceptually better to leave them at application level, leaving some logic in SQL can be way more performant. Loops don’t exist in SQL as it works on sets, and if conditions are the WHERE clauses. For else statements you can use CASE.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuccessive updates to a single table  are acceptable only if they affect different rows. Otherwise, combine the updates together to use the full power of indexes and avoid unnecessary visits!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid lookup functions when you can use joins. Sure, readability can decrease as in programming it’s good practice to simplify logic in functions, but the optimizer can’t examine the functions and performances are worse!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-tactical-dispositions\"\u003e3.

The performance decrease of one trigger is like the one with 2 indexes (Oracle)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are NOT a panacea. To justify the use of an index, it must provide benefit (including indexing foreign keys, that some systems do automatically but can cause locks and redundancy). The most efficient index is a unique one, with one row = one index value\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso, if you apply a function to the index (format, truncating a date, anything) the query will work but you will lose the advantages of the index\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSystem-generated incremental keys are an easy way to assign IDs, but can be a bottleneck in case of concurrent inserts, as there is one centralized generator assigning values to everyone.

The sooner we get rid of unnecessary data the less we have to process the query later\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention to DISTINCT, which can hide overlooked JOINS and it’s difficult to debug if you are missing data.

Einstein rejected black holes. Tidal forces are less at the horizon of large black holes. Einstein Equivalence Principle states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3 - Reimann proposed that space may be curved, an idea incorporated into General Relativity. Minkowski space incorporates space and time, with a world line representing the path of an object. Einstein discovered time dilation where rapidly moving clocks slow down. General Theory of Relativity states that objects move straight ahead through space-time. If space is curved, the object follows. Gravitational force is the curvature of space-time. John Wheeler proposed wormholes but they would stay open for so short a time that even light could not pass through. Einstein discovered (General Theory of Relativity) gravitational red shift where clocks slow down near a heavy mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4 - Duality of light - not only wavelike but particle like - Einstein 1905. Planck constant h = 6.62 x 10 exp -34.. Information conservation, or reversibility, states that given the present, one can construct the future and the past. Quantum Mechanics respects the conservation of information. Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle states that the greater the certainty of velocity, the lesser the certainty of position. m delta v delta x \u0026gt; h. When a system is derived of all energy it is in ground state. QM, however, states that particles are still in motion - zero point motion or the quantum jitters. Energy of a photon E = hf. In Quantum Field Theory, the path of a particle is a propagator. A split, such as in the release of a particle, is a vertex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5 - Planck found that if c, G (Newtons gravitational constant) and h are set to one, three fundamental Planck units result. The Planck length is very small (10 exp -35 m.), much smaller than a proton. Planck time (10 exp -42 sec) is very small, being the time it takes light to traverse the Planck length. Planck mass is about that of a dust mote. The energy equivalent is about equal to a tank of gasoline. The Planck length, time and mass are the size, half-life and mass of the smallest possible black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6 - The question of how black holes decay. A possibility is that quantum fluctuations would allow a piece of the horizon to fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7 - Equivalence of chemical, potential, kinetic and thermal energy. Conservation of energy is the First Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law states that entropy always increases. Entropy is a measure of the number of arrangements that conform to some specific recognizable criterion. Entropy is hidden information. Entropy increases because we lose track of the details over time. The smallest size containing a bit of information is a Planck length. Maximum amount of information that can be put into a region of space is equal to the area of the region, not the volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8 - John Wheeler stated that black holes have no hair, meaning the horizon was smooth. Adding one bit of information to a black hole increases its horizon by one square Planck length. Entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9 - Black holes have temperature which is inversely proportional to their size. Black holes are black bodies - they reflect no light. Black holes emit photons and therefore evaporate. A black hole the mass of the moon would be 1 deg K. One the mass of a boulder would be a billion billion deg. Photon emission from a BH is Hawking radiation. Hawking calculates that the entropy of a BH equals one quarter of the horizon area, measured in Planck units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10 - Hawking states that when a BH evaporates, the trapped bits of information disappear from the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11 - Particle collisions are described by an S or scattering matrix, which is reversible. Hawking invented the not S matrix or dollar matrix which is not reversible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12 - Surrounding space is warmer than astronomical BH\u0026rsquo;s, so they are still gathering mass rather than evaporating, although the evaporation rate is very slow. Einstein Equivalence Principle - the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13 - Susskind Antigravity Pill paradox where characters fall through a BH horizon. Apparently they are destroyed and emitted as evaporation products as required by QM. But apparently they also pass safely through the horizon as predicted by the Equivalence Principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14 - The possibility that a BH horizon is covered with quantum copying machines so that evaporation and passage are both possible. However, a quantum copying machine is not possible as it would violate Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15 - A BH stretched horizon is one Planck distance above the horizon. It is an energetic, hot layer. Susskind proposes complementarity whereby both alternatives of the paradox are true. No paradox because the observers on the inside and outside can never meet, so each story is true in it\u0026rsquo;s own zone of reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16 - It requires increasingly short wavelength (high energy) photons to observe smaller particles. As an atom falls closer to a horizon, it requires increasingly high energy photons to resolve them. So as the atom falls to the horizon, it becomes increasingly blurred and appears to spread out over the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17 - About Cambridge, religion and Hawkings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18 - The Holographic Principle - the contents of space are actually a holographic representation of the information on the area bounding that space. Perhaps all space / the universe is a hologram, coded on a distant two dimensional space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19 - String Theory - We do not know whether this model actually represents the real world. However, it is consistent with the real world and does allow theories to be tested for consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadrons are nucleons, mesons and glueballs. Nucleons are protons and neutrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you spin a nucleon, the energy increases in proportion to the angular momentum, but in steps. An electron cannot be spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnergetic nucleons are stringlike objects, made up of quarks and gluons. The simplest hadron is a meson, composed of a quark, an anti-quark joined by a stringlike gluon. Open strings, such as mesons, have ends, but there can also be closed strings. Nucleons are 3 quarks joined by a Y shaped string. Another hadron, the closed string or glueball, has no quarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mathematical theory of quarks and gluons is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks are elementary particles with six flavors - up, down, strange, charmed, bottom and top. All quarks come in three colours - blue, green and red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGluons have positive and negative poles, and each has a color - R, B or G. Therefore, nine types of gluon are possible. The propagator of a gluon has two sides corresponding to the two poles - each side is R, B or G. At a vertex, or split, each side must be consistent - e.g. a BR can split into BG - GR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile string theory applied to hadrons is well accepted, fundamental strings associated with gravity at Plank scales are not. The graviton is the primary fundamental string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrical and gravitational forces create waves. Hence, gravitational waves. Gravitons are conjecture. Any particle can emit a graviton, even other gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly, fundamental and QCD strings are the same objects at different scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamental strings require 9 dimensions. The 6 extra dimensions are compacted into geometric spaces called Calabi Yau Manifolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyman theorized that electrical force is due to particles continually emitting and absorbing photons - photon exchange. Also, all matter continually emits and absorbs gravitons. Fundamental strings spawn off and absorb tiny strings - these are the gravitons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe string theory of gravity is not fully described but appears to be the best mathematical model of quantum gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20 - As things slow down, more structure comes into view. Much structure cannot be seen due to cosmic jitter. Perhaps particles are much larger than thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21 - Going up the mass scale beyond elementary particles, are conjectural collections called superpartners, grand unification partners and string excitations. These range to the Planck mass. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) should see superpartners. T\u0026rsquo; Hooft speculates that the spectrum of particles extends beyond the Planck mass in the form of black holes. A 1 kg BH is a trillion times smaller than a proton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings, such as those making up photons, have temperature and entropy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entropy of a BH is proportional to the area of the horizon, and therefore the square of the mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings can cross each other, normally passing through each other. A small probability (the string coupling constant) exists that they split and re-arrange. This is how small strings are formed at a horizon, producing Hawking radiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an electron is dropped into a BH, it becomes charged. A charge on a BH pushes the horizon out from the singularity. If enough charge exists to balance the graviton, you have an extremal BH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolchinski discovered D-branes, a membrane on which fundamental strings can end. These turn out to fill a large mathematical hole in String Theory. The use of D-5 branes for the extra dimensions, D-1 branes for the normal dimensions, and fundamental strings allowed the math to be developed for an extremal BH showing that the entropy = one quarter of the horizon area. Also allowed the math of the evaporation process to be developed. This clinched the argument that BH are storage containers for information, not eaters of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22 - De Sitter space is a four dimensional (4 + 1) space with positive curvature that satisfies Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equations. It is becoming important in cosmology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti De Sitter (ADS) space is similar, but with negative curvature. The space time curvature in ADS creates a gravitational field that pulls objects back to the center even if there is nothing there. If matter is added to an ADS space, a BH trapped in the space (like a box) results - a BTZ black hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings on a stack of D-branes are governed by the same rules as those that govern gluons in QCD. Maldacena showed that a three dimensional world with gravity is equivalent to a two dimensional quantum hologram on the boundary of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitten showed that a BH in ADS must be equivalent to something on the surface bounding the the space - a hot fluid of gluons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 23 - The Holographic Principle states that everything that takes place in ADS (4+1) is describable by a mathematical theory with fewer dimensions. Quantum gravity in ADS is mathematically equivalent to QCD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an ADS space is modified to a Q space with both a UV (small scale) brane and an IR (large scale) brane, particles near the UV brane act like fundamental strings while those near the IR brane act like nuclear particles. The possibility is that fundamental particles and nuclear particles are really the same objects in different areas of space. The hot quark soup produced in nuclear collision events has an unexpected very low viscosity, as does a BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuclear physics may allow String Theory to be tested. Conversely, String Theory may be applicable to nuclear evenets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24 - It appears that the cosmological constant is non zero - 10 exp -123 in Planck units. Einstein had originally included an extra term in his equations, called the cosmological term. The constant (Greek lambda) creates a repulsive force if negative; attractive if positive. Eventually, Einstein set it to zero, eliminating it from his equations, and calling it his biggest mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cosmic horizon exists at 15 billion light years where the universe is receding from earth at the speed of light. This cosmic horizon may be analagous to BH horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91pPavXJjkL._AC_UF350,350_QL50_.jpg","permalink":"https://mutt0-ds.github.io/todo/the-black-hole-war/","title":"The Black Hole War"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNon puoi prevedere i grandi eventi inattesi, ma proverai a spiegarli a posteriori.

Ritorna una lista di valori unici, richiede una tabella o una lista di colonne, non può essere un espressione; se lo usi con piu di una colonna mostrerà tutte le combinazioni esistenti nei dati.

VALUES ritorna i valori distinti VISIBILI, quindi relativi ai filtri attivi, e lo stesso fa DISTINCT, ma hanno un’approccio diverso in caso di relazioni invalide. Suggerisco di vedere l’esempio, molto chiaro: se per esempio un prodotto manca dalla tabella, i Sales avranno alcuni valori BLANK. DISTINCT fa confusione nel calcolo dell’amount medio per prodotto, mentre VALUES lo considera correttamente nella divisione. Thumb rule mia: meglio usare VALUES dato che è ovunque nel libro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreve approfondimento su HASONEVALUE, che è una shortcut per  IF ( COUNTROWS ( VALUES ( [colonna] ) ) = 1, VALUES ( [colonna] ), e ha un secondo argomento per ritornare qualche messaggio se c’è piu di un valore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4--understanding-evaluation-context\"\u003e4 ⚠ Understanding Evaluation Context\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCi sono due contesti completamente differenti: filter context, che FILTRA DATI e row context, che ITERA TABELLE. Un contesto è l’ambiente in cui l’espressione viene valutata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filter-context\"\u003eFilter Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon riesco a spiegarlo bene quanto l’esempio nel capitolo, ma la mia interpretazione è: qualsiasi formula viene interpretata in base alla cella, che a sua volta esiste in base ai filtri e alle colonne che abbiamo inserito. Quindi TotalSales = SUMX(Sales[Amount] sarà 30mln se la metto in una card senza filtri, magari 1mln se seleziono solo Australia, o 30k in una tabella che divide per brand, ma è sempre la stessa cosa! Quello che conta è il contesto della cella che la esegue. Che è appunto il filter context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"row-context\"\u003eRow Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’esempio usa la colonna calcolata, che ricorda, ragiona riga per riga e agisce durante il data refresh, come Sales[Gross Margin] = Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ). Come fa DAX a capire quale riga sta iterando? Utilizzando il Row Context, che è sostanzialmente un cursore.\nSe scrivi Gross Margin come una misura, perdi il row context della CC, quindi serve un iteratore con X; Gross Margin := SUMX ( Sales, Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) )  funziona perchè usa l’iteratore SUMX che sa come tenere il contesto! Invece Gross Margin := Sales[Quantity] * ( Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost] ) è invalida\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"altre-note\"\u003eAltre note\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Prosegue con molti esempi interessanti delle difficoltà nel capire i due contesti, specialmente nei filtri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn caso di complesse funzioni che iterano in due contesti diversi, esiste la funzione EARLIER per considerare il layer più esterno. Sinceramente spero di non doverla usare, è decisamene tricky, lascio l’esempio nel libro per capire come funziona lo switch. Corrisponde in un certo modo al super() di Python. Il libro stesso dice che è meglio usare le variabili.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicordarsi che il row context itera una singola tabella, non filtra, e perciò non può usare le relazioni senza un RELATED/RELATEDTABLE. Invece un filter context usa le relazioni automaticamente, e si comporta diversamente a seconda della direzione (singola o both, vedi capitolo 15).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolto interessante l’esempio col SUMMARIZE nel caso del calcolo dell’età media dei clienti, senza considerare i doppioni: Il codice fa vedere come includere una colonna diversa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5--understanding-calculate-and-calculatetable\"\u003e5 ⚠ Understanding CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCALCULATE è la funzione più potente e importante di DAX e quella con più sfaccettature da scoprire. CALCULATETABLE è uguale ma restituisce una tabella. La loro complessità è data dal fatto che sono le uniche a creare nuovi filtri, e quindi modificare i filter context del capitolo 4. Anche qua, gli autori raccomandano di rileggere bene bene bene il capitolo e prestare attenzione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa formula è CALCULATE ( Expression, Condition1, \u0026hellip; ConditionN ), accettando qualsiasi espressione come primo parametro obbligatorio, e poi n filtri. Per i filtri, che sono delle tabelle/liste di valori, puoi usare un espressione \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso” che equivale a FILTER ( ALL ( \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] ), \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;[Brand] = \u0026ldquo;Contoso\u0026rdquo; ). Per leggibilità, tendi a usare la versione compatta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn breve, CALCULATE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFa una copia del filter context esistente\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eValuta ciascun filtro nei sui args, e, per ciascuna condizione, produce una lista di valori validi per la colonna specifica (nell’esempio, sarà {’Contoso’}). Equivale a un FILTER ALL (ricorda!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSe due o più filtri riguardano la stessa colonna, verranno uniti con un AND statement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsa la nuova condizione per sostituire i filtri esistenti o aggiungendoli al contesto se non ve ne sono presenti.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(VEDI GIU) Se c’è un row context, applica una Context Transition trasformandolo in un filter context e rimuovendo quello esistente\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuando ha finito, applica il nuovo filter context al modello, e una volta calcolato ritorna al contesto originario. Non è quindi una modifica permanente\nMolto importante: dato che CALCULATE usa un FILTER ( ALL) dietro le quinte, se vuoi evitare che tolga tutti i filtri dovrai usare la forma estesa della condizione, e utilizzare VALUES se vuoi mantenere i filtri correnti di altre tabelle, per esempio. Interessante il caso che mostra nel capitolo con un Ratio in relazione alla tabella Sales filtrata, mentre quella Date deve mantenere i filtri.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"filtrare-con-condizioni-complesse\"\u003eFiltrare con condizioni complesse\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC’è un esempio con uno slicer che prova a filtrare una CALCULATE, ma ovviamente dato che usa ALL nella versione compatta viene ignorato!

It automatically adds as filter arguments all the columns that are currently being iterated in any row context—filtering their actual value in the row being iterated\nIn soldoni, il CALCULATE utilizza il row context come FILTRO nel FILTER CONTEXT, dato che in sè non è un iterable. Questa è una transizione.\nOttimo esempio per ripassare il contesto. La formula Sum Num Of Sales := SUMX ( Sales, COUNTROWS ( Sales ) ), sorprendentemente, ritorna il COUNTROWS al Quadrato; infatti il # righe di Contoso è 37000, per esempio, e SUMX itera 37000 volte per ciascuna riga, quindi darà 37000*37000 dato che sta ragionando col row context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltro esempio: Sales Amount := SUMX ( Sales, CALCULATE ( SUM ( Sales[Quantity]))). Il segreto è che dietro le quinte CALCULATE sta creando dei filtri riga per riga dato che segue il row context nel SUMX, quindi farà Tot = CALCULATE(SUM ( Sales[Quantity] ), Sales[Product] = “A”)  + CALCULATE(SUM ( Sales[Quantity] ), Sales[Product] = “B”)\u0026hellip; eccetera per n volte\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa context transition (CT) è COSTOSA. Usa calculate parsimoniosamente, perchè nelle iterazioni applicherà il filtro per ciascuna riga\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT non filtra solo una riga, come potresti pensare. Il nuovo filtro transizionato filtra tutte le righe con lo stesso valore. Quindi se nell’esempio sopra abbiamo  Sales[Product] = “A”, potrebbero esserci piu di un risultato a seconda dei dati in input\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT usa colonne non presenti nella formula.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT crea un filter context a partire da un row context.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLa CT avviene quando c’è un row context (quindi negli iteratori e nelle colonne calcolate).

I peggiori competitor di una specie (in sopravvivenza) è la specie stessa. Potremmo fare qualcosa per Prestigio (attori) o Dominanza (dittatori), e mandiamo segnali impliciti e esplicit con i nostri atteggniamenti.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNorme: abbiamo delle norme da rispettare, e spesso le manteniamo con concetti come gossip e reputazione. Devi rispettare le regole del tuo gruppo sociale o rischi l’ostracizzazione\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBarare: con la giusta scusa non ci facciamo problemi a barare; un segreto puo essere di pubblico dominio finchè nessuno lo sdogana (e.g. il vestito dell’imperatore e sacchetti di carta a NY)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutoinganno: concetto interessante, in breve le persone che performano meglio sono quello che si impongono da soli cose a cui credere (vedi soldati). O meglio, convinci l’avversario a credere a qualcosa. Ci sono 4 archetipi: Madman → Nixon che fa il pazzo per convincere gli altri a trattare, Loyalist → “Sure I’ll go along with your beliefs”, Cheerleader → Propaganda, tipo startup founder che è forzatamente ottimista e Cheater → che si mente da solo forzatamente perchè sa che è la soluzione migliore.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContraffazione: ci sono due emisferi, destro e sinistro.

Negano che non sappi cosa faccia l’altro emisfero. In molti casi facciamo lo stesso, il nostro lavoro non è avere decisioni, ma motivarle!

Il famoso “scherzo eh”. Devo tenerlo d’occhio che non bisogna confondere l’altro con questa cosa\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConversazioni: non trattare le conversazioni come un semplice scambio di info: io e tu dai a me in cambio.

Ma non funziona come una trattativa commerciale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConsumo: questo è un po vago, comunque parla della rat race su cui non dobbiamo cascare, dato che il nostro status sociale non deve finire nel flex e nello showing off, non serve. Puntiamo sul patrimonio invece delle cose sfuggenti, empiriche. è difficile perchè nella società moderna giudichiamo le persone per quello che hanno, non per quello che sono\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Arte: questo interessante. L’arte ha una funzione di mostrare quanto tempo libero e energia abbiamo per creare qualcosa di apparentemente inutile (fin dai cavernicoli con le pitture). Infatti disegniamo le repliche, e se scopriamo che un opera d’arte è una foto perde molto di valore! Noi apprezziamo l’arte per lo sbatti che si è preso l’artista nel consegnarcela.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Benficenza: anche la beneficenza nasconde secondi fini. Una grossa parte dei benefattori non controlla dove finiscono i suoi soldi e se la compagnia no-profit li usa in modo efficiente. Anzi, quando hanno provate ad analizzare il ROB si sono indignati. Questo è un controsenso, se ci fregasse vorremmo sapere se vengono usati bene i soldi. Questo perchè 1. lo vediamo come una cosa lontana, ergo frega poco, e 2. lo facciamo per far sapere al mondo che siamo buoni (o le donazioni sarebbero anonime)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEducazione: se i top college volessero aiutare piu studenti, allargherebbero i posti. Ma costano di piu perchè sono limitati, non perchè c’è un educazione migliore (ma miglior network, vedi statistiche). Peraltro a scuola ti insegnano ad adattarti ed essere misurato, blah blah\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e⭐ Medicina: imbottirci di medicina e andare dal medico per ogni cosa è un classico modo per far vedere che ci stiamo sforzando per la nostra salute e che siamo intervenuti… Medicina è una forma elaborata di bacino sulla bua. Vari studi che spendere di piu non comporta miglior probabilità di sopravvivere, ma sfortunatamente non ragioniamo cosi quando stiamo male, vogliamo il meglio e subito. Se vogliamo vivere a lungo sarebbe meglio non fumare, bere, mangiare sano, fare ginnastica, etc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReligione: piu che la religione in se la gente è accomunata da quello in cui crede, nei riti e le norme della propria comunità. è piu un sistema sociale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePolitica: i votanti non votano per interesse personale (tanto varebbe poco il voto singolo) ma come segnale per mostrare appoggio a una causa in cui credono (destra/sinistra).

alt=\"image\"\u003e\nI said earlier that the CEO sent back many of my attempts to get this work done. Really, she rejected two things. The rst was an underdeveloped strategic plan that was almost entirely about system and architectural details and lacked very few forward-thinking ideas beyond the next 6 to 12 months.

Per quelli risolvibili, bisogna affrontarli e non lasciarli a macerare dentro. Già iniziando con un approccio tranquillo (senza alzar la voce, criticare l\u0026rsquo;altro o usare sarcasmo) aumenta tantissimo le probabilità di risolvere la cosa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl secondo trucco è di trovare metodi riparativi.

L\u0026rsquo;obiettivo in questi casi è di essere aperti e parlare del problema, non risolverlo.
